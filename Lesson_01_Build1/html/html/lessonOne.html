                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">I am sure our viewers must have found that useful. But Mr. Fox, according to you what is the most common mastake people make while selecting a business?</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px" data-width="230px">The most common mistake and the most costly one, is not selecting the right business initially.</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px" data-width="230px">To select the right business you have to visualize every step, plan every move, and evaluate it with a "Fox" and "Against" list.</p>
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">Can you elaborate more on this?</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px" data-width="230px">Sure. In my book "Starting a Business", I have given some tips about how to select a business. Please refer to page 130-134.</p>

                <div class="part5">
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">So you see, it is important to select a business that is best suited to you. Before we move forward let's have a quick quiz.</p>
                </div>

                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">That brings us to another break. Till we come back, take a look at the points we will discuss in our next segment.</p>
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">Welcome back, so Mr. Fox once it's decided what business you want to do, what should be the next step for an entrepreneur?</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px">Once you are decided what business you want to start, the most important thing is planning and preparation.</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px">As you can see Ms. James, I still have those do's and don'ts written here on this board.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="part8">
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">Those are indeed important points and one should always consider them not only at the initial stage of busness but throughout one's professional life.</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px">Yes, always.</p>
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">Once you finish going through the detailed evaluation procedure, make sure that you are ready to face this new challenge in your life.</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px">Your preparation doesn't end till you get completely qualified.</p>
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">What do you mean by conpletely qualified?</p>
                  <p data-top="210px" data-right="260px">When I say completely qualified that does not mean only academically.</p>
                  <p data-top="250px" data-left="200px">Before we move to our last segment, let's have another quick quiz.</p>
