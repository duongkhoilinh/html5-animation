In this segment, we are going to discuss:
What things one should decide before starting a business.
How to select a business that is just right for you. 
Sally James: Yes Mr. Fox, tell us about your journey to this point in time.
Mr. Fox: Initially when I thought about starting a new business I encountered many questions, such as:
Am I up to it?
What industry, where to locate, etc.?
Should I choose a full time or part time opportunity?
Let's go back a few years. I would like to share the answers I found to these questions, through my own experiences.
Sally James: Click the highlighted calendar to learn about Mr. Fox's journey.
Mr. Fox: These are the three questions every person who wants to initiate a business should first ask himself. Let us take these questions one by one and see why we should ask them.
Question 1: Am I up to it?
You should ask this to yourself because:
You are putting some (not all, hopefully) of your net worth at risk. You may run the risk of creating a life that is out of balance, with working hours taking away from other family or pleasurable activities. There may be levels of stress you have not experienced as an employee.
Secondly, you should ask:
What business do you want to start and where do you want to locate it?
You must decide which type of business is best for you.
where your expertise lies.
Where to locate that business.
And the most importantly you should decide whether it's going to be a part time or is it going to be a full-time venture?
Is it going to be full-time?
Are you going to devote all your time to it, or will it be part-time? 
There are some advantages and some pitfalls in operating as a part-time business.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Take a break for now. If you wish to know more about the advantages and disadvantages of a part-time business, click on the white board.
The advantages of starting a part-time business outweigh the risks:
You conserve your earnings including retirement, health and fringe benefits and vacations.
Your full-time job won't suffer if you compartmentalize your job and business into completely separate worlds.
You can avoid conflict of interest with your job by choosing a business that is appropriate for part-time business such as, real estate, specialized food, e-commerce, direct marketing or family-run operations.
There are many advantages to operating a family business. If you are a part-timer the family can run the business while you are at work. You have a built-in organizational structure. You can teach your kids the benefits of being in business.
Some disadvantages of starting a part-time business are:
There is a possible temptation to spend time at your job working on your business.
That is unfair to your employer.
You may end up competing with your employer, which is not right. Think of how you would feel or handle this employee if you were the boss.
Any kind of conflict with your regular work can jeopardize your job and your business.
Mental and physical exhaustion can become a very real problem for part-time entrepreneurs.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Welcome back! Let's now move on to our next segment of today's interview.
Mr. Fox, how did you know that the business you'd selected was right for you?
Mr. Fox: Honest self-evaluation is the key. It helped me figure out if I had the capabilities to run my own business successfully.
Plus, deciding which business was right for me involved a lot of planning, based on my experience and knowledge of the market in which I planned to operate.
Here's a checklist that outlines how you can choose a business that is right for you.
Sally James: Click the laptop to learn more.
How to select a business that's right for you:
If you have not selected a business, take the time and wait to find the ideal business for you.
Try to identify a business that has long-term economic potential.
Don't try to tackle or pursue businesses that may be too challenging in multiple ways. It is better to identify a one-foot hurdle than to try to jump a seven-footer!
Determine the pricing power of the service business you are considering. Most service businesses have pricing power. Pricing power means that you will not need to have the lowest price in order to secure business.Your customers will be willing to pay a fair price for a better product or service. 
Avoid a “commodity” business where you must compete entirely on price and in which you must have the lowest cost to survive.
Specialize. Keep in mind that as a general rule specialists do better than non-specialists.
If you are manufacturing a product, consider the pros and cons of out-sourcing production to a low-cost supplier. In other words, operate a "Hollow" corporation. A " Hollow " corporation is a company that subcontracts manufacturing and packaging.
Plan for a business that you know a lot about. Should you bet on a business you don't know anything about, when you can bet on a business you know fairly well.
If your business is based on marketing an invention or patent, remember:
a. First check to determine if there are any issued patents similar to your idea. You can secure information from the U.S. Patent office at www.uspto.gov.
b. Be cautious about getting involved with firms that ask for up-front fees to market an invention.
c. No matter what you hope for, you will need a product to test, to show and to solicit feedback.
Operate a business that will grow in today's and tomorrow's markets. Study market trends and try and foresee where the trend is leading to. ]]></TranscriptText>

I am sure our viewers must have found that useful. But, Mr. Fox, according to you what is the most common mistake people  make while selecting a business?
Mr. Fox: The most common mistake and the most costly one, is not selecting the right business initially. To select the right business you have to visualize every step, plan every move, and evaluate it with a 'For' and 'Against' list.
Sally James: Can you elaborate more on this?
Mr. Fox: Sure. In my book 'Starting a Business', I have given some tips about how to select a business. Please refer to page 130-134.
How to select a business?
Write down an activity you like to perform (make this the heading). Make a separate page for each activity or interest you have.
On these sheets list as many businesses you can think of that are related to the activity on each sheet.
List all the products or services you can think of that are related to that activity. Use your imagination and think of every possible product or service you could perform.
Make a list of businesses that do better in bad times (one may be appropriate for you). Some examples might be pawnshops, auto repairs and fabric stores.
Let's assume you end up with three potential businesses.
You can now make a comparative evaluation using a checklist with a 1-10 scoring system. This kind of analysis can help you gain objectivity in selecting your business.
Evaluating the business you are in or have in mind:
Is it something I will enjoy doing? As Harvey McKay has said, Find something you love to do and you'll never have to work a day in your life. Also, if you're doing something you love, you're much more likely to stick with it through thick and thin times.
Will it serve an expanding need for which there is no close substitute?
Can I be so good at a specialized, targeted need that customers will think there is no close substitute?
Can I handle the capital requirements? 
Can I learn the business by working for someone else first?
Could I operate as a hollow corporation, without a factory and with a minimum number of employees? You might consider outsourcing to a manufacturing vendor. Cost saving is often the prime objective, but you also free up your time and capital. The major risk is the performance of the vendor and your success in developing good relationships that provide mutual benefits.
Is this a product or service that I can test first? Your concept of a successful product or service may not be in harmony with the reality of the market place. On a small scale, pilot test it first.
Should I consider a partner who has complementary skills or who could help finance the business?
Evaluating your business using a 'For' and 'Against' list.
Make a 'for' and 'against' list regarding characteristics of the business. Be as objective as you can. If the items on the 'For' list substantially outweigh the ones on the 'Against', go for it! If on the contrary, it is the reverse, rethink your business plan seriously.
Write down the names of at least five successful businesses in your chosen field. Analyze what these five businesses have in common and make a list of reasons for their success.
Talk to several people in your intended business. Seek out the pitfalls - better now than after you have started off. Write down the information as soon as you can.
Analyze the other players in the market that are not doing well and write down the possible reasons for their sluggish growth.
So you see, before selecting a business, you have to consider following points.
MARKETING PROBLEM
DECISION FACTORS
RELEVANT INFORMATION
BEST ALTERNATIVE
MARKETING PLAN
EVALUATION

In this segment, we will discuss:
Do's, Don'ts, and things you should watch out for at the initial stage of starting a business. 
How ready are you for the new business?
Essential qualities that are required to become a successful entrepreneur.
Welcome back, so Mr. Fox once it's decided what business you want to do, what should be the next step for an entrepreneur?
Mr. Fox: Once you are decided what business you want to start, the most important thing is planning and preparation. As you can see Ms. James, I still have those do's and don'ts written here on this board.
Things to Watch Out for:
Impatience, overconfidence and enthusiasm can prevent you from analyzing your business carefully. Work out the negative aspects; it is much better to be aware of them and face them early on.
Be wary of the lure of quick and high rewards.  If you have selected the right business, it will grow in time and reward you for your efforts.
Do's
Live prudently and begin saving up money for operating your business.
Learn your business by working for someone else in the same business first.
Consider the benefits of starting a part-time business.
Consider the advantages of operating a family business.
Objectively measure your skills and training against potential competition.
Consider subcontracting to low cost suppliers if you're manufacturing a product.
Test market your product or service before starting or expanding.
Make a 'for' and 'against' list describing the business you are in or considering.
Talk to a lot of people for advice.
Make a comparative analysis of all opportunities you are considering.
Don'ts
Don't quit your job before you have completed start-up plans.
Don't consider operating a business in a field you do not enjoy.
Don't risk all the family assets. Limit your liabilities to a predetermined amount.
Don't compete with your employer in a part-time business.
Don't be in a hurry to select a business. There is no penalty for missed opportunities.
Don't select a business that is too high a risk or hurdle.
Don't operate a business in which you must have the lowest price to succeed.
Don't neglect to learn the negative aspects of an intended business.
Don't permit entrepreneurial self-confidence to outweigh business sense.
Don't allow the promise of a conceptual high reward deter reality testing first.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Fox: Yes, always.
Sally James: Once you finish going through the detailed evaluation procedure, make sure that you are ready to face this new challenge in your life.
Mr. Fox: Your preparation doesn't end till you get completely qualified.
Sally James: What do you mean by completely qualified?
Mr. Fox: When I say completely qualified that does not mean only academically. 
The best way to become qualified is to:
Go to work for someone in the same business.
Attend all classes you can on the skills you need: for example, accounting, computing, and selling.
Read as many relevant 'How To' books as you can.
Be brave and ask questions or seek help from the most successful individuals in your intended business.

Entrepreneurial instinct
Business sense
Finances
Here, read this. This is about the essential qualities of a successful entrepreneur.
Sally James: The essential qualities of a successful entrepreneur
Entrepreneurial instinct
You must have an entrepreneurial instinct, which is an overwhelming desire to have your own business. You must have the guts and dedication to be completely devoted to your goal. Remember, devotion to your goal is more likely if you have a love for your intended business!
Business sense
To become a successful entrepreneur, you should have a working knowledge of the business you plan to opearte, before you start it. Common sense, combined with appropriate experience, is what is known as business sense.
Finances
Every business owner needs sufficient money to maintain a positive cash flow for at least a year. Many businesses can be started on a very small scale with a small investment. Then, as the business grows and you gain experience, cash flow from your business can be used for growth. In some cases, you don't need starting capital to hire other people because you might start by doing everything yourself. 
These are absolutely the basic and essential qualities an entrepreneur should have, in order to become successful.
Now we are at the end of our program. Thanks for being on our show Mr. Fox. It was a great pleasure to have you on our show.
Mr. Fox: Thanks Ms. James for having me on your show. It was a great experience to share my knowledge with you and your viewers.
Sally James: In our next episode we will discuss how to forecast future cash requirements through proper cash flow control.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Fox: At a very basic level, it is a written description of your business’s future - a roadmap to chart the course of your business. 
Sally: But is it really possible to predict all of the changing conditions in which a business will operate right at the outset?
Mr. Fox: A good question Ms. James! No, it’s not possible to predict how things will go at the outset, which is why entrepreneurs must periodically review and update their plan. 
Mr. Fox: Creating a Business Plan: Why a Sound Business Plan is Vital to the Health of Your Business?
What is a business plan?
A business plan is a written description of your business’s future. It is a document that describes what you plan to do and how you plan to do it.

Audience : So how exactly will a business plan help my new business?
Mr. Fox: A business plan can help you in many ways. They’re used by investment-seeking entrepreneurs like you to convey your vision to potential investors, or by firms that are trying to attract key employees, or prospects for new business, or deal with suppliers or simply to understand how to manage companies better.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Fox: You’d be wrong to assume that! 
There are, in fact, four types of business plans.
The Mini Plan, which is a great way to quickly test a business concept or measure the interest of a potential partner or minor investor.
The Working Plan, which is a tool to be used to operate your business. 
The Presentation Plan, which is suitable for showing to bankers, investors and others outside the company, and 
The Electronic Plan, which is useful as more and more business information that previously was transferred between parties only on paper is now done electronically.
Sally: Now that you know what a business plan is, the different types of business plans, and how it helps your new business, let’s do a Quick Quiz before moving on to the next segment.

Sally: Before you put pen to paper, it’s important to organize your plan. In this segment, we will discuss how to assess your business’s goals and objectives:
Plan your plan
Your financing goals
How to use your plan
Sally: Writing a business plan greatly increases the chances that your business venture will succeed. But how true is it that before starting to draft the plan, you need to plan your draft?
Mr. Fox: Business plans are complicated documents. When drafting the plan, if you think about the various business decisions in advance, you are able to minimize the time you spend planning your business and maximize the time you spend generating income.
Mr. Fox: To sum up, planning your plan will help control your degree of accountability and reduce time-wasting indecisiveness. To plan your plan:
Decide what your goals and objectives in the business are
Assess the business you’ve chosen to start, to see what the chances are, that it will actually attain those objectives
Look at common elements of different plans to get an idea of the ones you want to include and how each will be treated
Sally: When you say goals and objectives, do you mean the financial goals of an enterprise? 
Mr. Fox: Absolutely! A business can rarely fund its own growth by generating profits. Simply because you have to pay your own suppliers before your customers pay you. So to manage the cash flows, many fast-growing companies seek bank financing or equity sales to finance their growth.

Mr. Fox: surrendering Control: The amount of control you’ll have to surrender: An equal partner may demand approximately equal control.
Mr. Fox: The amount of money you’re likely to need: Almost any source of funds, from a bank to a benefactor, have some guidelines about the size of financing preferred. Anticipating the size of your needs now will help in preparing your plan.
Mr. Fox: The cost: This can be measured in terms of interest rates and shares of ownership as well as in time, paperwork and plain old hassles.

Audience 1(bubble 1): I am aware that a business plan can be used for several things, like monitoring the company’s progress or getting key employees to join the firm. But how is it relevant to the planning stages?
Mr. Fox: It is very relevant. Because deciding how you intend to use your business plan is an important part of preparing to write it. Let me ask you, What do you want to do with your business plan?
Audience 1(bubble 2): I want to use it to help raise money for my business.
Mr. Fox: That’s great! When you want to use your business plan to raise money, you’ll have to focus very carefully on the Executive Summary, Management, and Marketing and Financial aspects.
Mr. Fox: For those of you who are looking for a bank loan, you’ll need to stress on your ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service loans.
Mr. Fox:If you’re going to approach equity investors, especially venture capitalists, you must show them how they can:
Cash-out of your company and generate an acceptable rate of return.
Mr. Fox: If you intend to use your plan to attract talented employees, then you’ll want to emphasize things, such as stock options and other aspects of compensation as well as location, work environment, corporate culture and opportunities for growth and advancement.
Mr. Fox: If you want to use your plan to demonstrate credibility to suppliers, you may want to stress your blue-ribbon customer list and spotless record of repaying trade debts in order to convince the supplier to favor you over your rivals. It may also help you arrange supplier credit.
Sally: I am sure everyone of you now appreciates the importance of organizing your business plans before actually writing them down! So, while we take a small break, please take this quiz!

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally:  Welcome back from the break. We’re still in conversation with the Entrepreneur of the Year… Mr. Chris Fox!
Let’s launch straight into the topic for our next segment – How to write a Business Plan? 
Sally: So we’ve understood the need for a business plan and about gathering information to create one. But most entrepreneurs struggle when it comes to actually writing their business plan. 
That is why in this segment we will focus on three crucial components of a business plan:
Business plan formats.
Elements of a business plan.
Sample Business Plan Template.
Sally: Just before we started the program, many of in our audience wanted to know, how do we actually put a business plan together? 
Mr. Fox: Well, you’ll need to include your
Business goals
The strategies you’ll use to meet them
Potential challenges that may confront your business and ways to solve them
The organizational structure of your business (including titles and responsibilities)
The capital required to finance your venture and keep it going until it breaks even. 
That’s what you need to include in your business plan. But let’s do this in a little more detail.
Mr. Fox: A good business plan follows generally accepted guidelines for both form and content. There are three primary parts to a business plan:
business concept 
marketplace section
financial section
Business Concept: The first is the business concept, where you discuss the industry, your business structure, your particular product or service, and how you plan to make your business a success.
Marketplace Section: The second is the marketplace section, in which you describe and analyze potential customers: who and where they are, what makes them buy and so on. Here, you also describe the competition and how you’ll position yourself to beat it.
Financial Section: Finally, the financial section contains your income and cash flow statement, balance sheet and other financial ratios, such as break-even analyses. This part may require help from your accountant and the use of a good spreadsheet software program.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Audience : What about other key components, such as the Executive Summary? 
Mr. Fox: Breaking these three major sections down even further, will give you the seven key components of your business plan. That includes the, 
1. Executive summary
2. Business description
3. Market strategies
4. Competitive analysis
5. Design and development plan
6. Operations and management plan
7. Financial factors
Sally: And someone told me that a business plan should also have a cover, title page and a table of contents.
Mr. Fox: Absolutely! But not before you’ve worked in detail each of the seven essential sections of your business plan! 
Sally: Why don’t we look at each section with a few samples, so our audience gets to see how it’s done? 
Mr. Fox: That’s a great idea! Let’s take a look at a template that I have here.
Mr. Fox: The executive summary follows the title page. It should clearly state what you want, or are asking for. Make sure it is short and businesslike, and no longer than half a page. Definitely not longer than one page! Within that space, provide a synopsis of your entire business plan.
Let’s now look at the mechanics of writing an Executive Summary.
Mr. Fox: Try it out before making your own custom plan!
Business concept: Business concept describes the business, the product and the market it will serve. It should point out just exactly what will be sold, to whom and why the business would hold a competitive advantage.
Financial features highlight the important financial points of the business including sales, profits, cash flows and return on investment.
Financial requirements should clearly state the capital needed to start the business and to expand it. It should detail how the capital will be used, and the equity, if any, that will be provided for funding. If the loan for initial capital will be based on security instead of equity, you should also specify the source of collateral.
Current business position furnishes relevant information about the company, when it was formed, its legal form of operation, the principal owners and key personnel.
Major achievements should detail any developments within the company that are essential to the success of the business. Major achievements include items like patents, prototypes, location of a facility, any crucial contracts that need to be in place for product development, or results from any test marketing that has been conducted.
Sally: That’s a lot of information to pack into a half page summary!  To see how much of it you can remember, fill out the business plan template that will appear on your screen at intervals.

Mr. Fox: That’s right. This section usually begins with a short description of the industry.
Audience : Would that mean an overview of the industry?
Mr. Fox: Actually, at this stage you need to go into more detail.
When you describe the industry, discuss the present outlook as well as future possibilities.
Provide information on all the various markets within the industry, including any new products or developments that will benefit or adversely affect your business.
Base your observations on reliable data and be sure to footnote sources of information as appropriate. This is important if you’re seeking funding; the investor will want to know just how dependable your information is, and won’t risk money on assumptions or conjecture.

Mr. Fox: That is right!
Structure: When describing your business, concentrate on its structure. Structure means the type of operation, e.g., wholesale, retail, food service, manufacturing or service-oriented. Also state whether the business is new or already established.
Ownership: Detail whether the business is a sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation, who its principals are, and what they will bring to the business.
Support: Mention who you will sell to, how the product will be distributed, and the business’s support systems, including advertising, promotions and customer service. 
Products & Services: Describe the products or services you intend to market. The product description statement should give the reader a clear idea of any unique features or variations from concepts that can typically be found in the industry.
Competitive Edge: Be specific in showing how you will give your business a competitive edge. For example, 
Your business will be better because you will supply a full line of products.
You’re going to provide service after the sale. 
Your merchandise will be of higher quality.
You’ll give a money-back guarantee.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Audience : Mr. Fox, could you give a specific example of how I can tell potential investors that my business is better? 
Mr. Fox: Your competitive edge is really specific to your business idea. But just to give an example, you could say your business will be better because you will supply a full line of products OR that you’re going to provide service after the sale OR your merchandise will be of higher quality OR simply that you’ll give a money-back guarantee.
Sally: That will set them thinking, alright! But is that all there is to business description? 
Mr. Fox: No, the last part of the business description is actually a question. So ask yourself, “How can I turn a buck? And why do I think I can make a profit that way?” Answer that question for yourself, and then convey that answer to others in the business concept section.
Success Factors: You don’t have to write 25 pages on why your business will be profitable. Just explain the factors you think will make it successful, e.g., 
It’s a well-organized business
It will have state-of-the-art equipment
Its location is exceptional
The market is ready for it
It’s a dynamite product at a fair price
Profits: Show why your business is going to be profitable. A potential lender is going to want to know how successful you’re going to be in this particular business. If you’re using your business plan as a document for financial purposes, explain why the added equity or debt money is going to make your business more profitable.
Sally: The template will come up on your screen again! Let’s see how well you do in the business description section!

Chris Fox: Market Strategies is the next topic, where we will see how to define the market in your business plan.
Sally: In this segment, we will discuss the different aspects of market strategies:
Projecting market share
Positioning your business
Pricing
Distribution
Promotion plan
Sales potential
Sally: The question on top of my mind is why do we need to delve into market strategies, so early on?
Mr. Fox: Defining the market is just one step in your analysis. With the information you’ve gained through market research, you need to develop strategies that will allow you to fulfill your objectives. Market strategies are the result of a meticulous market analysis.
Here, you can read what I hoped to achieve from my market analysis:
Mr. Fox: Market Analysis:
Forces the entrepreneur to become familiar with all aspects of the market so that the target market can be defined and the company can be positioned in order to garner its share of sales.
Enables the entrepreneur to establish pricing, distribution and promotional strategies that will allow the company to become profitable within a competitive environment.
Provides an indication of the growth potential within the industry, and this will allow you to develop your own estimates for the future of your business.
Begin your market analysis by defining the market in terms of size, structure, growth prospects, trends and sales potential.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Fox : Most definitely!  You must be able to estimate market share for the time period that your business plan will cover.
To estimate market share for the time period that your business plan will cover, consider these two factors:
Industry growth which will increase the total number of users.
Conversion of users from the total feasible market.

It should merely point out exactly how you want your product perceived by both customers and the competition.
Sally : The key idea is to keep it short and simple!  And now we move on to Pricing.
Mr. Fox: Pricing your product right is important because it will have a direct effect on the success of your business. Though pricing strategy and computations can be complex, the basic rules of pricing are straightforward.
Sally : Could you elaborate a little on them?
Mr. Fox : Here’s my little Rule Book.
The basic rules of pricing are,
All prices must cover costs.
The best and most effective way of lowering your sales prices is to lower costs.
Your prices must reflect the dynamics of cost, demand, changes in the market and response to your competition.
Prices must be established to assure sales. Don’t price against a competitive operation alone. Rather, price to sell.
Product utility, longevity, maintenance and end use must be judged continually, and target prices adjusted accordingly.
Prices must be set to preserve order in the marketplace.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Audience: Do we consider Distribution when determining Market Strategies?
Mr. Fox: Yes. And a good way to determine your distribution strategies is to analyze the channels your competitors are using. And then decide whether to use the same type of channel or an alternative that may provide you with a strategic advantage. 
Lets take a look at some of the more common distribution channels. 
Mr. Fox: Direct Sales:
The most effective distribution channel is to sell directly to the end-user.
Mr. Fox: OEM (original equipment manufacturer) sales
When your product is sold to the OEM, it is incorporated into their finished product and it is distributed to the end user.
Mr. Fox: Manufacturer’s Representatives
One of the best ways to distribute a product, is through manufacturer’s reps, that is, through salespeople who operate out of agencies that handle an assortment of complementary products and divide their selling time among them.
Mr. Fox: Wholesale distributors
Using this channel, a manufacturer sells to a wholesaler, who in turn sells it to a retailer or other agent for further distribution through the channel until it reaches the end user. 
Mr. Fox: Brokers
Third-party distributors often buy directly from the distributor or wholesaler and sell to retailers or end users.
Mr. Fox: Retail distributors
Distributing a product through this channel is important if the end user of your product is the general public consumer.
Mr. Fox: Direct Mail
Selling to the end user using a direct mail campaign.

Audience 1 : Advertising!
Audience 2 : Packaging? 
Audience 3 : Public relations…
Audience 4 : Sales promotions.
Audience 5 : Personal sales!
Sally :  That’s a lot of answers! So, which is the correct answer? How would you describe a promotion plan?
Mr. Fox: The promotion plan describes your strategy, which is basically the controlled distribution of communication designed to sell your product or service.
And so, all of your answers are correct. 
The promotion strategy encompasses every marketing tool utilized in the communication effort. 
Advertising: Includes the advertising budget, creative message(s), and at least the first quarter’s media schedule.
Packaging. Provides a description of the packaging strategy. If available, mockups of any labels, trademarks or service marks should be included. 
Public relations: A complete account of the publicity strategy including a list of media that will be approached as well as a schedule of planned events. 
Sales promotions: Establishes the strategies used to support the sales message.  This includes a description of collateral marketing material as well as a schedule of planned promotional activities such as special sales, coupons, contests and premium awards.

Mr. Fox : Yes. After defining the market, positioning the product, pricing, distribution, and promotion strategies, you finally need to make financial projections to demonstrate the sales potential of your business. 
The sales or revenue model charts the potential for the product, as well as the business, over a set period of time, ideally 3 years or 5 years.

Sally: We will take an in-depth look at the purpose oftalk about why we need competitive analysis. We will and also discuss how to Create a competitive strength grid.    
In this section, we will discuss: 
What is the purpose of competitive analysis
How to create a competitive strength grid
Sally: Why competitive analysis?
Mr. Fox:  Because, it helps an entrepreneur determine the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors. Based on that you can develop strategies that will provide you with a distinct advantage, or create barriers to prevent competition from entering your market. Plus, you can exploit any weaknesses within the product development cycle. 
Audience : Mr. Fox, I’d like to know how to go about competitive analysis?
Mr. Fox:  The first step in a competitor analysis is to identify the current and potential competition.
Once you’ve grouped your competitors, you can start to analyze their strategies and identify the areas where they’re most vulnerable.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Audience : Mr. Fox  you mentioned the competitive strength grid. Is it some kind of a list of the competitive advantages or weaknesses that you have over your competitors? 
Mr. Fox:  It’s a list alright! It is a scale that lists all your major competitors or strategic groups based upon their applicable assets and skills and how your own company fits on this scale.
Audience : And how can we put together such a grid?
Mr. Fox: To put together a competitive strength grid, 
1. List all the key assets and skills down the left margin of a piece of paper.
2. Along the top, write down two column headers: “weakness” and “strength.”
3. In each asset or skill category, place all the competitors that have weaknesses in that particular category under the weakness column, and all those that have strengths in that specific category in the strength column.
4. After you’ve finished, you’ll be able to determine just where you stand in relation to the other firms competing in your industry.
5. Once you’ve established the key assets and skills necessary to succeed in this business and have defined your distinct competitive advantage, you need to communicate them in a strategic form that will attract market share as well as defend it. You need to establish this competitive advantage clearly so the reader understands not only how you will accomplish your goals, but also why your strategy will work.
When you establish the competitive advantage clearly, the reader understands not only how you will accomplish your goals, but also why your strategy will work.
Sally: Going in for a short break at this point, while you see how well you can describe your Marketing Strategies in the Business Plan!

Sally: Here we will discuss:
Procedures
Scheduling and costs
Development budget
Personnel
Assessing risks
Sally: My first question Mr. Fox is - what is the purpose of the design and development plan?
Mr. Fox: To provide investors with a description of the product’s design; chart its development within the context of production, marketing and the company itself; create a development budget that will enable the company to reach its goals.
Click the highlighted image to learn more.
There are generally three areas in the development plan section:

Market development
Organizational development

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally: To reach goals, we need to set goals. 
Mr. Fox: That’s right Ms. James! The first step in the development process is setting goals for the overall development plan. And we need to have procedures in place to achieve that.
With your goals set and expertise in place, you need to form a set of procedural tasks or work assignments for each area of the development plan. 
Procedures will have to be developed for product development, market development, and organization development. 
In some cases, product and organization can be combined if the list of procedures is short enough. 
Procedures should include how resources will be allocated, who is in charge of accomplishing each goal, and how everything will interact.

Scheduling includes all of the key work elements as well as the stages the product must pass through before customer delivery. 
It should also be tied to the development budget so that expenses can be tracked. 
Its main purpose is to establish time frames for completion of all work assignments and juxtapose them within the stages through which the product must pass.
When producing the schedule, provide a column for each procedural task, how long it takes, start date and stop date.

Mr. Fox: Well, your company has to have the proper expertise in key areas to succeed. But not every company will start a business with the expertise required in every key area. So, the proper personnel have to be recruited, integrated into the development process, and managed so that everyone forms a team that is focused on the achievement of the development goals.
Mr. Fox: Assessing risks helps you assess different possibilities.
The risks involved in developing the product should be assessed and a plan developed to address each one.
The risks during the development stage will usually center on technical development of the product, marketing, personnel requirements, and financial problems.
By identifying and addressing each of the perceived risks during the development period, you will allay some of your major fears concerning the project and those of investors as well.
Sally: And so we come back to another Quick Quiz!

Sally: In this segment, we will discuss the two important aspects of any business:
Operations and Management Plan
The organizational structure of the company 
The expense associated with its operation, and 
The capital requirements associated with its operation.
Create a cost of goods table
Sally: Would you elaborate on the organizational structure, Mr. Fox?
Mr. Fox: The organizational structure of the company is an essential element within a business plan because it provides a basis from which to project operating expenses. This is critical to the formation of financial statements, which are heavily scrutinized by investors. So, the organizational structure has to be well defined and based within a realistic framework given the parameters of the business.
Operations and Management Plan
The parameters of the business are:
The logistics of the organization such as the various responsibilities of the management team.
The tasks assigned to each division within the company.
Capital and expense requirements related to the operations of the business.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Audience : But every business is different. And is structured according to its own requirements and goals. So how can we generalize the operations structure? 
Mr. Fox: Despite their different requirements, there are four stages for organizing a business. 
1. Establish a list of the tasks using the broadest of classifications possible.
2. Organize these tasks into departments that produce an efficient line of communications between staff and management.
3. Determine the type of personnel required to perform each task.
4. Establish the function of each task and how it will relate to the generation of revenue within the company.

Audience : But why should we tackle financial tables at the operation planning stage?
Mr. Fox: These financial tables will work as the foundation for the next part of your business plan, which is the “Financial Component”.
Financial Component
The financial tables that you’ll develop within the operations plan include:
The operating expense table
The capital requirements table
The cost of goods table 
Sally: Next we will see how to calculate overhead expenses. They are the expenses associated with your company’s operation. Am I right? 
Mr. Fox: Yes! Once the organization’s operations have been planned, the expenses associated with the operation of the business can be developed. These are usually referred to as overhead expenses.
Sally: First, we have the operating expenses table, where we calculate overhead expenses. 
Overhead expenses usually include:
Travel
Maintenance and repair
Equipment leases
Rent
Advertising & promotion
Supplies
Utilities
Packaging & shipping
Payroll taxes and benefits
Uncollectible receivables
Professional services
Insurance
Loan payments
Depreciation]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Mr. Fox: That was the easy bit. The next task is a little more challenging. It involves developing a capital requirements table.
Sally: What is a capital requirements table?
Mr. Fox: A capital requirements table depicts the amount of money necessary to purchase the equipment you’ll use to establish and continue operations. It also illustrates the amount of depreciation your company will incur based on all equipment elements purchased with a lifetime of more than one year.
Sally: And how can we generate the capital requirements table.
Mr. Fox: Just go through the table here.
Capital Requirements Table: 
To generate the capital requirements table, 
First establish the various elements within the business that will require capital investment.
For service businesses, capital is usually tied to the various pieces of equipment used to service customers.
Capital for manufacturing companies, on the other hand, is based on the equipment required in order to produce the product.
Determine the number of units or customers, in terms of sales, that each equipment item can adequately handle. This is important because capital requirements are a product of income, which is produced through unit sales.
Keep in mind that depreciation is an expense that shows the decrease in value of the equipment throughout its effective lifetime. You may need to seek consultation from an expert in this area.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally: And next we will learn how to create a cost of goods table.
Mr. Fox: Please remember that this table is used only for businesses where the product is placed into inventory.
For a retail or wholesale business, cost of goods sold - or cost of sales – refers to the purchase of products for resale, i.e. the inventory. The products that are sold are logged into cost of goods as an expense of the sale, while those that aren’t sold remain in inventory.
For a manufacturing firm, cost of goods is the cost incurred by the company to manufacture its product. As in retail, the merchandise that is sold is expensed as a cost of goods, while merchandise that isn’t sold is placed in inventory.
Sally: And that brings us to another quick quiz!  See how comfortable you are with the Operations and Management Plan, while we take a short break. 
Mr. Fox: Cost of goods has to be accounted for in the operations of a business. It is an important yardstick for measuring the firm’s profitability for the cash-flow statement and income statement.
It is also one of the most complicated tables you’ll have to develop for your business plan, but it’s an integral part of portraying the flow of inventory through your operations, the placement of assets within the company, and the rate at which your inventory turns.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally: And that brings us to the last and perhaps the most important component of a Business Plan - The Financial component! Astute investors look carefully at the charts, tables, formulas and spreadsheets in the financial section.
Sally: Here we will discuss the three common financial statements:
Cash flow statement
Income statement
Balance sheet
Mr. Fox: These three statements are interlinked, with changes in one necessarily altering the others, but they measure quite different aspects of a company’s financial health.
Cash Flow Statement
The cash-flow statement is one of the most critical information tools for your business. It shows a schedule of the money coming into the business and expenses that need to be paid.
how much cash will be needed to meet obligations
when it is going to be required
from where it will come
Roll your mouse over the icons below to learn more about the items that you’ll need to include in the cash-flow statement.
This is the order in which they should appear.
1) Cash sales is the income derived from sales paid by cash.
2) Receivables is the amount not yet received from sales that have been previously made. The expectation is that payment will be received shortly, based on the agreement you have with your customer
3) Other income is the income derived from investments, interest on loans that have been extended, and the liquidation of any assets.
4) Total income is the sum of all sales and other income.
5) Material/merchandise is the raw material used in the manufacture of a product (for manufacturing operations only), the cash outlay for merchandise inventory (for merchandisers such as wholesalers and retailers), or the supplies used in the performance of a service. 
6) are all costs on the income statement except for direct labour, direct materials and direct expenses.  Overhead expenses can include accounting fees, advertising, insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, taxes, telephone expense ect.
7) Marketing/sales means all salaries, commissions, and other direct costs associated with the marketing and sales departments.
8) is all the expenses associated with the research and development activities within the organization 
9) Taxes means all taxes, except payroll, paid to the appropriate government institutions. 
10) Capital required to obtain any equipment elements that are needed for the generation of income. 
11) Loan payment is the total of all payments made to reduce any long-term debts.
12) Total expenses is the sum of material, direct labor, overhead expenses, marketing, sales, G&A, taxes, capital and loan payments 
13) Cash flow is the difference between total income and total expenses. This amount is carried over to the next period as beginning cash. 
14) Cumulative cash flow is the difference between current cash flow and cash flow from the previous period.
Income statement
The Income statement is a simple and straightforward report on the proposed business’s cash-generating ability. It draws information from the various financial models developed earlier such as revenue, expenses, capital (in the form of depreciation), and cost of goods. By combining these elements, the income statement illustrates just how much your company makes or loses during the year by subtracting cost of goods and expenses from revenue to arrive at a net result - which is either a profit or a loss. It’s formed by listing your financial projections.
Roll your mouse over the below icons to learn more about the items that you’ll need to include in the cash-flow statement.
This is the order in which they should appear.
1) Income includes all the income generated by the business and its sources.
2) Cost of goods includes all the costs related to the sale of products in inventory.
3) Gross profit margin is the difference between revenue and cost of goods. It can be expressed in dollars, as a percentage, or both. As a percentage, the GP margin is always stated as a percentage of revenue.
4) Operating expenses includes all overhead and labor expenses associated with the operations of the business.
5) Total expenses is the sum of all overhead and labor expenses required to operate the business.
6) Net profit is the difference between gross profit margin and total expenses, the net income depicts the business’s debt and capital capabilities.
7) Depreciation reflects the decrease in value of capital assets used to generate income. Also used as the basis for a tax deduction and an indicator of the flow of money into new capital.
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is generated solely on an annual basis for the business plan and is, a summary of all the preceding financial information broken down into three areas:
Assets
Liabilities
Equity
To obtain financing for a new business, you may need to provide a projection of the balance sheet over the period of time the business plan covers. More importantly, you’ll need to include a personal financial statement or balance sheet instead of one 
Current assets:
Current assets are assets that will be converted to cash or will be used by the business in a year or less. Current assets include:
Cash is the cash on hand at the time books are closed at the end of the fiscal year.
Accounts receivable is the income derived from credit accounts. For the balance sheet, it’s the total amount of income to be received that is logged into the books at the close of the fiscal year.
Inventory is derived from the cost of goods table. It’s the inventory of material used to manufacture a product not yet sold.
Total current assets is the sum of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and supplies.
Other assets that appear in the balance sheet are called long-term or fixed assets. They are called long-term because they are durable and will last more than one year. 
Examples of this type of asset include:
Capital and plant refers to the book value of all capital equipment and property (if you own the land and building), less depreciation.
Investment includes all investments by the company that cannot be converted to cash in less than one year. For the most part, companies just starting out have not accumulated long-term investments.
Miscellaneous assets are all other long-term assets that are not “capital and plant” or “investments.”
Total long-term assets is the sum of capital and plant, investments, and miscellaneous assets.
Total assets is the sum of total current assets and total long-term assets.
If the debts are due in one year or less, they are classified as current liabilities. Examples of current liabilities are as follows:
Accounts payable, which are all expenses derived from purchasing items from regular creditors on an open account, which are due and payable.
Accrued liabilities, which are all expenses incurred by the business which are required for operation but have not been paid at the time the books are closed. These expenses are usually the company’s overhead and salaries.
Taxes comprise all taxes that are still due and payable at the time the books are closed.
Total current liabilities is the sum of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and taxes.
If liabilities are due in more than one year, they are long-term liabilities. Long-term liabilities include:
Bonds payable is the total of all bonds at the end of the year that are due and payable over a period exceeding one year 
Mortgage payable refers to loans taken out for the purchase of real property that are repaid over a long-term period. The mortgage payable is that amount still due at the close of books for the year.
Notes payable is the amount still owed on any long-term debts that will not be repaid during the current fiscal year.
Total long-term liabilities is the sum of bonds payable, mortgage payable, and notes payable.
Total liabilities is the sum of total current and long-term liabilities.
Mr. Fox: Once the liabilities have been listed, the final portion of the balance sheet-owner’s equity-needs to be calculated. The amount attributed to owner’s equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. The amount of equity the owner has in the business is an important yardstick used by investors when evaluating the company. Many times it determines the amount of capital they feel they can safely invest in the business.
Sally: Now that you’ve mastered the writing of a business plan, we will finish off this segment with a quick quiz.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally: Welcome back everyone! After that marathon session about the different aspects of how to actually write a business plan, I now invite Mr. Fox to this Q & A session, where he will take questions from the audience and share with you the Essential Factors of a Great Business Plan!
Sally: Before throwing the floor open, let’s take a quick look at the areas up for discussion:
A sound business concept
Understanding of your market
A healthy, growing and stable industry
Able financial control
A consistent business focus
A mindset to anticipate change
Include plans for conducting business online
Audience : Mr. Fox, what would you say is the single most common mistake made by entrepreneurs?
Mr. Fox: The single most common mistake made by entrepreneurs has to be not selecting the right business initially. The best way to learn about your prospective business is to work for someone else in that business before beginning your own. There can be a huge gap between your concept of a fine business and reality. So it’s very important to have a sound business concept.
Audience : Mr. Fox, I feel that my understanding of the market at the time of writing a business plan is hypothetical. Is there some way I can get actual insights into the market? 
Mr. Fox: A good way to test your understanding of your market is to test market your product or service before you start. You think you have a great kite that will capture the imagination of kite fliers throughout the world? Then craft some of them and try selling them first. That’s the best way to improve your understanding of your market.
Audience : Is it true that a path breaking idea or invention is important for a successful business? 
Mr. Fox: On the contrary, I’d advise you to be a part of a healthy, growing and stable industry. Remember that some of the great inventions of all time, like airplanes and cars, did not result in economic benefit for many of those who tried to exploit these great advances. Success comes to those who find businesses with great economics and not necessarily great inventions or advances to mankind.
Audience : Although I appreciate the importance of accounting in business, I do not come from accounting background. What is the best way to overcome this shortcoming? 
Mr. Fox: Most entrepreneurs do not come from accounting backgrounds and must go back to school to learn these skills. Because you cannot overlook the importance of becoming qualified in accounting, computer software and cash flow management.  After all, would you bet your savings in a game where you don’t know how to keep score? People mistakenly do it in business all the time. But able financial control is crucial to running a business and making it successful.
Audience : Entrepreneurship experts talk about not having to compete solely on the basis of price. But isn’t price important?
Mr. Fox: The stress here is on a consistent business focus. As a rule, people who specialize in a product or service will do better than people who do not specialize. So, focus your efforts on something that you can do so well that you will not be competing solely on the basis of price.
Audience : But then what about flexibility to accommodate new market developments?
Mr. Fox: Focusing is not the same as breeding rigidity. An entrepreneur needs to specialize with a mindset to anticipate change. Don’t commit yourself too early. Keep a fluid mindset and be aggressive in making revisions as warranted by changing circumstances and expanding knowledge.
Audience : I want to take my business online. Would that be a good move? 
Mr. Fox: Most definitely! Consumers and business-to-business online sales are set to expand exponentially in the coming decade, and small retailers can reach an ever-increasing pool of customers. So any entrepreneur must include plans for conducting business online.
Sally: Thank you for making the time to interact with our audience, Mr. Fox! We will take a quick break now and while we are gone, our audience will take a quiz.]]></TranscriptText>

Sally: In this segment we will discuss,
What to avoid in your business plan, and Do’s and don’ts.
Sally: I am really impatient to find out what these tips and tricks are that you want to share with us. And I think so is our audience! 
Mr. Fox: What I am going to share with everyone here are tips about what to avoid in your business plan. And small tricks about the do’s and don’ts of business.
Place some reasonable limits on long-term, future projections. (Long-term means over one year.)
It’s better to stick with short-term objectives and modify the plan as your business progresses. Too often, long-range planning becomes meaningless because the reality of your business can be different from your initial concept.
Avoid optimism. In fact, to offset optimism, be extremely conservative in predicting capital requirements, timelines, sales and profits. Few business plans correctly anticipate how much money and time will be required.
Do not ignore spelling out what your strategies will be in the event of business adversities.
Use simple language in explaining the issues. Make it easy to read and understand. 
Don’t depend entirely on the uniqueness of your business or even a patented invention. Success comes to those who start businesses with great economics and not necessarily great inventions.]]></TranscriptText>

Package your business plan in an attractive kit as a selling tool.
Submit your business plan to experts in your intended business for their advice.

So, please welcome back Mr. Fox as he tells you how to Get Help With Your Plan!!
Sally: In this segment we will discuss: 
Hiring a consultant
Organizations
Software and books
Sample business plans
Sally: Many entrepreneurs in the audience today told me that they had to spend a lot of time on communication before and during the process of working with a consultant. So how useful is the idea of working with a consultant?
Mr. Fox: Well, most consultants are legitimate experts in specific or general business areas. And most consultants can be hired to help with all or part of the process of writing a business plan.
But when you hire a consultant, make sure that you have fully explained — and the consultant fully understands — the nature of your business, your concept and strategy, your financial needs, and other matters such as control, future plans and so on.
Refer to these important issues throughout the process. You don’t want to pay for a beautifully done plan that fits somebody else’s business, not yours!
Sally: Do you have any guidelines for anyone here who might want to hire a consultant?
Mr. Fox: Of course! If you decide to hire a consultant to help you prepare your plan, take care to select the right person.
Here are some guidelines when hiring a consultant:
Get referrals. Ask colleagues, acquaintances and professionals such as bankers, accountants and lawyers for the names of business planning consultants they recommend. A good referral goes a long way to easing any concerns you may have.
Look for a fit. Find a consultant who is an expert in helping businesses like yours. Ideally, the consultant should have a lot of experience with companies of similar size and age in similar industries. Avoid general business experts or those who lack experience in your field.
Check references. Get the names of at least three clients the consultant has helped to write plans. Call the former clients and ask about the consultant’s performance. Was the consultant’s final fee in line with the original estimate? Was the plan completed on time? Did it serve the intended purpose?
Get it in writing. Have a legal contract for the consultant’s services. It should discuss in detail the fee, when it will be paid and under what circumstances. And make sure you get a detailed written description of what the consultant must do to earn the fee.

Mr. Fox: They are quite useful as they offer guidance to individuals and small businesses. 
Here are some organizations that you can look up:
Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)
SBDCs offer a wide variety of information and guidance to individuals and small businesses. If you need help developing your business plan, the SBDC counselor scan help by offering assistance with market research, cash-flow projections and more. And, in most cases, the help is free.
SCORE
The Service Corps of Retired Executives, more commonly known as SCORE, is an on profit group of mostly retired businesspeople who volunteer to provide counseling to small businesses at no charge.
National Business Incubation Association
The NBIA is the national organization for business incubators, which are organizations especially set up to nurture young firms and help them survive and grow. Incubators provide leased office facilities on flexible terms, shared business services, management assistance, help in obtaining financing, and technical support. Its services include providing a directory to local incubators and their services.
Chamber of Commerce
The many chambers of commerce throughout the United States are organizations devoted to providing networking, lobbying, training and more. Among the services the U.S. Chamber of Commerce offers is a web-based business solutions program that provides online help with specific small-business needs, including planning, marketing and other tasks such as creating a press release, collecting a bad debt, recruiting employees or creating a retirement plan.

Tonight in our studio we have Mr. Chris Fox, the winner of this year’s Business Person of the Year Award by the Chamber of Commerce. Welcome to the third episode of “Startup Entrepreneurs”, Mr. Fox. 
Sally James: In the previous episodes, our viewers saw how to select the business that’s just right for them and how to create a business plan. What’s on the agenda today? 
Chris Fox: We’re going to see how computers and communication tools can contribute to the smooth and efficient running of a business, and help to optimize profits. Here’s a list of the main topics we will be seeing today.
Sally James: In this episode, we will discuss:
Types of communication
Basic communication tools
Computers
Internet
Technology planning
Checklist for getting your business online
Sally James: Communication plays an important role in our lives. But how important is it in setting up and running a successful business?
Chris Fox: The success of any business lies in the effectiveness of corporate Communication. Unless potential clients and customers are aware of your business, they will not have the information to contact you or to purchase your products and services. When they are familiar with you or your business, they should be able to communicate easily with you.
Let’s start by looking at the points we are going to cover in this segment.
Sally James: In this segment, we will discuss:

This type of communication includes brochures, advertisements, contact letters, telephone calls and websites.
Brand Image is extremely important in external communication!
Your logo should represent who you are, your letterhead should be a selling tool, and your telephone message should reflect your professionalism.

Sally James: That’s interesting. Could you tell us more about these tools and devices?
Chris Fox: Telephones
The standard telephone (landline)
The standard telephone has many options. Ensure there is at least one line that is unique to your business, with an answering machine that plays a professional sounding welcome message mentioning your company name.
IP telephones-With IP phones, you can use your Internet connection to connect to anywhere in the world, at call rates that are usually lower than standard telephones.
The cellular/smart phone-A cell phone ensures that you don’t miss any calls. Plus you can get a model that can receive your e-mails, play media files, access the Internet, store your contacts, and maintain your calendar.
Satellite phones-Satellite phones are invaluable if your business involves traveling in remote locations. They use communication satellites to send signals across the world and can be used in even the most inaccessible locations.]]></TranscriptText>

Chris Fox: 
Telephone tips
Treat the telephone as an important business tool.
Have a separate line for your business phone and your personal phone.
A remote (voice mail) answering system is preferable to an answering machine.
Use a headset for both cordless phones and cell phones.
When leaving phone messages, clearly state your name and phone number at the beginning and at the end of the message.
Get a toll-free number that you can publicize on your website, business cards and any other form of printed or online branding material.

Chris Fox: In shared-systems environment, by integrating fax’s capabilities with automated office equipment, you can rapidly transmit a wide variety of material to multiple receivers.
Chris Fox: Although many businesses still maintain some kind of fax capability, the technology has increasing competition from Internet-based systems.
Sally James: Perhaps. But fax machines have an edge, especially in the transmission of sensitive material.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Chris Fox: That’s true. Also, in some countries they have greater leverage as electronic signatures on contracts are not recognized by law while faxed contract copies with signatures are recognized.
Sally James: That’s really useful information! 
I was also wondering if you can tell us about Fax Servers. I have heard that stand-alone fax machines are being replaced by “fax servers”.
Chris Fox: Yes, Ms. James, in many corporate environments, stand-alone fax machines have been replaced by “fax servers” and other computerized systems capable of receiving and storing incoming faxes electronically, and then routing them to users on paper or via email (which may be secured).
Sally James: How does it help the business? 
Chris Fox: It helps by lowering overhead costs. There is no longer a need for unnecessary printouts and also the number of inbound phone lines needed by an office is reduced.
Sally James: So what would you recommend—a simple fax machine or an “all-in-one” model that not only faxes but also prints and scans?
Chris Fox: I’d say, consider your budget and space constraints. Also, the simpler the machine, the less problems you will have with it.
Sally James: That’s right.
Chris Fox: For those viewers who travel on a frequent basis and are not always near a fax machine, a fax number that works with your e-mail system is useful. In this case, sending a fax works just as on a normal machine. But you can receive it as an attachment to an e-mail. 
Sally James: Before we move forward, click the Tips  icon to read about facsimile tips.
Sally James: Facsimile Tips:
Use a cover page that is appropriate for your company. Remember that this is an external communication reflecting your business and image.
Use a separate dedicated phone line for your fax machine.
Sally James: Before we look at the next communication device for your business, let’s take a quick quiz to check your understanding.]]></TranscriptText>

Chris Fox: Microcomputers are the most common type of computers that we use, whether at work, in school, or at home. 
They were called “microcomputers” because of the single chip microprocessors that they use. Today the newer computers that you can purchase today, often have multiple “chips” to increase  the working speed of the computer, but we have retained the use of the term “microcomputers”.
Sally James: But the problem with computers is that they soon become obsolete. 
Chris Fox: The thing to know here is that if your computer fulfills the basic business needs, such as word processing, e-mail, accounting, and spreadsheet work, maybe you don’t need a top-of the-line computer! ]]></TranscriptText>

Chris Fox: Laptops offer an advantage. Here, read this article in Business Time titled “How Laptops Can Be a Big Help In Your Business?”
Chris Fox: Laptops Offer You Tremendous Business Advantage!
Here are few tips you. 
A laptop computer is portable. 
It usually does not include a printer so that will have to be purchased as an additional item.
Another option is a docking station that allows you to plug your laptop into a unit at your office.
Laptops tend to be a bit more expensive than desktops but if you travel and need computing capability, it is worth the extra expense.
Consider getting a laptop with wireless capabilities. 
Laptops are not as easy to upgrade as desktop computers because of the nature of their construction.
You need to be sure you get all the features you need when you purchase your laptop.
Getting a laptop with an extended battery is another good idea.]]></TranscriptText>

Chris Fox: That’s a good question. Because, when you buy a computer it comes with several software packages already bundled into the system. Here are a few important points that you should be aware of …
Chris Fox: Software is the key to making your computer productive. 
At the bare minimum, it should allow you to do word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and access the internet.
Microsoft Office offers an array of powerful tools for word processing, e-mail, spreadsheets, presentations, organization, and much more.
Consider investing in financial and accounting software appropriate for your business.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: So now we know all about computer software. 
Chris Fox: Yes. Let’s now talk about auxiliary products.
Sally James: What are auxiliary products?
Chris Fox: Digital cameras, printers, and scanners are examples of some auxiliary products. If you want to use these devices with your computer, you will require specifically designed software. Remember that they enhance the functionality and image of your business. Click the highlighted folder in the monitor to learn more. 
Chris Fox: Digital camera
A picture taken with a digital  camera can be directly loaded onto your computer. You can use these pictures when preparing product catalogs or anything where a picture would benefit your presentation.
Chris Fox: Scanner
When you want to convert a printed document to a digital document, you can use the scanner to make a digital image of your document.
Chris Fox: Wireless transmission
This feature allows you to communicate with other devices equipped with the same wireless feature. Being able to simply access the other device without hunting for the cord and plugs, is very appealing and has many productive implications.
Chris Fox: External memory devices
Taking regular external backups of your business data is an important part of working with computers. You can store your backup data on CD’s, USB flash drives or external hard discs. You can also check out services provided on the Web that facilitate an offsite backup of your important business data.
Chris Fox: Printers
There are a variety of printers available in the market to suit your needs and budget. If you require high volume and good quality prints, go for a laser printer. If you need color printouts, consider an ink-jet. But for high color quality, you’ll need a color laser printer.
Chris Fox: Desktop computer
A Desktop computer is a personal computer (PC) for regular use at a single location, as opposed to a laptop or portable computer. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical tower cases to small form factor models that can be tucked behind an LCD monitor. Most modern desktop computers have separate screens and keyboards.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Talking of desktops and laptops, what would you recommend for a new business?
Chris Fox: Let’s take a look at this comparison chart. That will give our viewers a clear idea of the pros and cons of each.
Chris Fox: Spare parts and extensions for desktops tend to be standardized, resulting in lower prices and greater availability.
Desktops have several standardized expansion slots, while laptops do not typically have expansion capability.
Assembly procedures for desktops tend to be simpler and more standardized. 
Power consumption by desktops is not as critical as laptops, since they are powered from the wall socket.
Laptops with special CPUs (developed by Intel and AMD) consume less power and produce lower heat. But they often have lower performance levels.
Desktop computers are usually more reliable because they are not being constantly moved around like laptops normally are.
Sally James: Before we go to the next communication tool, let’s take a quick quiz to check our understanding.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Chris Fox: Now that you know about laptops and their benefits, click the folder in the laptop to learn more about them.
Chris Fox:A laptop or a notebook is a personal computer designed for mobile use. It is small enough to sit on your lap.
A laptop has most of the typical components of a desktop computer, such as a display, a keyboard, a pointing device (a touchpad, also known as a track pad, or a pointing stick) as well as a battery, into a single small and light unit.
The rechargeable battery is charged from an AC/DC adapter (i.e., a wall wart) and stores enough energy to run the laptop for several hours.
Laptops are shaped like a large notebook and weigh between 3 to 12 pounds (1.4 to 5.4 kg).
Most laptops are designed in the flip form factor to protect the screen and the keyboard when closed.
In ‘tablet’ laptops the display panel can be twisted and laid flat on the keyboard housing.
They usually have a touch screen display and some include handwriting recognition or graphics drawing capability.
Laptops are fast becoming obligatory in businesses, for student use, as well as more popular for general use.
Chris Fox: Portability is where laptops score over desktops. Portability means that a laptop can be carried along and used in many places at home, in the office, while commuting and during flights, at clients’ location or in a meeting room. 
The portability feature offers several distinct advantages:
Getting more done. Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC can’t be used, and at times that would otherwise be wasted. For example, an office worker managing his e-mails during an hour-long commute by train.
Immediacy. Immediacy allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to present a problem or a solution anytime, anywhere.
Up-to-date information. Using a single laptop at  two locations avoids the problem of synchronization entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.
Connectivity. A proliferation of Wi-Fi wireless networks and cellular broadband data services combined with a near-ubiquitous support by laptops means that a laptop can have easy Internet and local network connectivity while remaining mobile.
Chris Fox: Size - Laptops are smaller than standard PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium. For example, in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away.
Low power consumption - Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20-90 W, compared to 100-800 W for desktops. 
Quiet - Laptops are quieter than desktops, due both to better components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.
Battery- A charged laptop can run several hours in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and brownouts.
Disadvantages
Performance
Laptops are significantly more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.
The upper limits of performance of laptops are a little bit lower, and “leading edge” features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.
However, for Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even netbook-class laptops are generally fast enough.
Standard laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. 
Number-crunching software (databases, math, engineering, financial, etc.) is the area where the laptops are at the biggest disadvantage. 
Chris Fox: Upgradeability
Upgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops. 
Hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily.
Optical drives and internal expansion cards may be upgraded if they follow an industry standard, but all other internal components, including the CPU and graphics, are not intended to be upgradeable.
Some upgrades can be performed by adding external devices, either USB or in expansion card format such a PC Card: sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and other peripherals.
However, upgrades usually impair the laptop’s portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is moved.
Chris Fox:Durability
Due to their portability, laptops are subject to more physical damage than desktops.
Original external components are expensive. 
Inexpensive parts are often bundled with larger and more expensive components. And the repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel may exceed the value of a used laptop!
In certain cases, inexpensive parts may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician.
Laptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a fan and heat sink that can fail due to eventual clogging by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Without removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, the system overheats even at idle load levels.
Battery life of laptops is limited; the capacity drops with time, necessitating an eventual replacement after a few years.
Chris Fox:Security
Being expensive, common and portable, laptops are prized targets for theft.
The cost of the stolen business or personal data and of the resulting problems (identity theft, credit card fraud, breach of privacy laws) can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself.
Most laptops have a Kensington security slot which is used to tether the computer to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock.
In addition to this, modern operating systems and third-party software offer disk encryption functionality that renders the data on the laptop’s hard drive unreadable without a key or a pass-phrase.

Chris Fox: To answer that, I’d like to share some of my notes during a seminar on Technology and it’s Different Aspects.
Chris Fox: Tablets - Tablets, such as the very popular Apple ipad , resemble writing slates. You can attach keyboards via a wireless or USB connection. Designed for mobility and ruggedness, they are ideal for health care, education, and field work.
Convertibles - Convertible notebooks have a base body with an attached keyboard. Heavier and larger than tablets, They have a screen that rotates around 180º, as well as fold down on top of the keyboard to provide a flat writing surface. Convertibles offer the keyboard and pointing device of older notebooks.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: So far so good! We have discussed the different types of computers, their hardware and software in detail. But how can businesses optimize their link to communicate with the world? The Internet? 
Chris Fox: Yes, in today’s business environment, every entrepreneur needs to know how their business can communicate with the world. To know that, we will have to visit the Server room. While we walk down to the Server Room, our viewers can go through the points we are going to cover in this segment.
Sally James: In this segment, we will discuss:
Internet and how you can
Leverage the internet for business use
Connect to the internet
Use the internet innovatively and in new ways
And use it for the benefit of your business
Chris Fox: The Internet’s ability to share information globally, makes it a valuable resource. In addition to global communication, businesses can use the Internet for corporate research, product development, customer support, and marketing. In particular, the World Wide Web offers a user-friendly way for a company to distribute information about its products and services and access information from other businesses.
If you are planning to connect your business to the Internet, here is a list of questions you should ask:
How many employees will need access to the Internet? How many will need simultaneous access?
What will be your primary use of the Internet?
What computer equipment is available for connecting to the Internet?
Are computers at your company connected with a Local Area Network (LAN)?
Do your computers contain sensitive or confidential information? How important is security?
Do you plan on creating an Internet presence for your company?
Do you have onsite computer professionals?
Sally James: What are the different ways in which a business can connect to the Internet? 
Chris Fox: To connect to the Internet, you can use:
Dial-up modem connections can comfortably serve only one user at a time.
Integrated Services Digital Networks, or broadband provide continuous connectivity at faster speeds and can service an entire workgroup attached to a LAN.
Chris Fox: An Internet Service Provider can help determine the best way for your business to connect to the Internet. Before selecting a provider, be sure to evaluate what the provider offers.
Ask about:
The range of connectivity options
The upgrading possibilities
The quality 
The availability of support staff
The provider’s connection to the rest of the Internet
The availability of customized services
Finally, check with the Better Business Bureau for a report on the provider.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Like all things new and modern, are there any technological advances with web technology that businesses can benefit from? 
Chris Fox: Absolutely. Many businesses are successfully sharing information with their customers using new web technologies, such as blogs , podcasts and other forms of social media.
Chris Fox: Podcasting is a useful tool to deliver learning and communication on the move. Corporate blogging is another communication tool for a business. Take a look at some interesting examples of both of these phenomena.
Here are some interesting examples of blogs and podcasts:
Blogs are used by individuals to record their observations online. Business analysts, teachers and journalists are among the many people keeping a public commentary of their thoughts.
Podcasts allow audio files to be downloaded to MP3 players, mobile phones and other digital devices. Users can listen to the broadcasts where they want, when they want. They can elect to receive the podcast automatically through RSS feeds.
The term Social Media refers to the use of web-based and mobile technologies to turn communication into an interactive dialogue. Enabled by ubiquitously accessible and scalable communication techniques, social media substantially change the way of communication between organizations, communities, as well as individuals.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Internet does make it easy for businesses to communicate to a global audience. But for a start-up entrepreneur, the real question is, how can the Internet benefit their business?
Chris Fox: A very valid question! There are several ways in which entrepreneurs can use the Internet to grow their business. Click on this TV screen to learn more.
Chris Fox: How Can The Internet Benefit Your Business?
While traditional industries like manufacturing are shrinking, new industries are growing — especially the information industries.
You can use the Internet to find your customers and business partners worldwide.
Your customers and partners can find you on the Internet.
You can use the Internet to build a strong relationship with your customers especially via email, facebook and twitter.
You can use the Internet to market your products and services.
You can use the Internet to acquire all the information, training and qualifications you need for your business.
You can set up a business with a very small marketing budget, something almost impossible in the real world.
Chris Fox:
Learn more about the practical uses of Internet in business. 
Keep pace with the technology developments in the world and put your business online! 
Read the checklist to getting your business online.
Chris Fox:
Reach a worldwide audience
The Internet is a worldwide network that allows you to reach a larger audience than even very expensive advertising.
Save on literature costs
Providing the information online reduces the need to print and mail product literature. This results in significant cost reductions.
Provide product information
The Internet has an unsurpassed ability to make information about your company’s products or services available to potential customers.
Augment/replace phone banks
By designing simple graphical interfaces you can enable customers to find the information they want quickly and inexpensively.
Chris Fox:
Provide easy access to customer service representatives
Human interaction cannot be totally replaced by even the best graphical interface. So, if customers have a question, or would like to speak with a person, provide a list of contacts and phone numbers or allow them to send email directly to a customer service representative, requesting that they be contacted.
Level your customer service load
If your customers are leaving unsatisfied because customer service lines are busy, use the email to provide secondary communication that can help level the load. This way, customers with problems that do not require immediate attention can send an email message through your website, which can be handled when support people are not busy or who are dedicated to email support.
Inexpensively create/augment your corporate image
It is easy and inexpensive to define your company image on the Internet, whether you are a one-person-company or a large corporation. If your company information changes rapidly due to market forces, there is no easier way to change your image than electronically.
Recruit new employees
Most companies, provide current information about job openings and attract talented people from places they could not reach otherwise.
Chris Fox:
Provide your service on-line
Online delivery of products and services will help to automate billing and inventory control and will also increase accuracy and reduce your accounting and product storage costs.
Give customers access to searchable information
Online information systems can help your customers find the information you are providing, quickly. For example, Federal Express created a website to enable customers to track their packages, and simultaneously, provided a useful customer service while also promoting their product!
Help customers understand why they need you
The Internet allows you to extend your expertise virtually. For example, you manufacture thermopane windows. A spreadsheet application could allow potential customers to determine how much money they would save in energy costs if they installed your windows.
Provide useful information to attract customers
Providing useful information to potential customers is a good way to get them to come to your site and return often (a property called “stickiness”).
Chris Fox:
Let customers try a sample of your product or service
Many new Web tools allow consumers to try out a sample what you have to offer before they buy. Gain a competitive advantage by offering a “test drive” of your product or service.
Eliminate the middleman
Middlemen exist in some industries where there are barriers, to direct contact between producers and consumers. The Internet is a vehicle for removing these barriers. This lowers prices for consumers and increases profits for producers.
On-line commerce
Some products and services are well suited for sales on-line. Rapid growth in this area has occurred as secure credit card transactions are now standardized. Efficiency of shipping and delivery methods for hard goods is important for typically impatient Internet shoppers.
Consider an Intranet
Use the same Internet technology within your company to help workers communicate better and work more productively. Many companies are finding an Intranet to be a much more cost effective solution to their network information needs than proprietary software.]]></TranscriptText>

Sally James: In this segment, we will discuss:
Technology Planning
Present and future use
Identifying appropriate technology
Allowing for advances in technology
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail!
Sally James: Technology is an unavoidable cost of doing business in the 21st century. So, let’s start with finding out what is Technology Plan and why is it important?
Chris Fox:  Like any business plan, a technology plan lays out a documented strategy for your company. 
Chris Fox: And here is why a technology plan is important for a business. 
Why technology planning is important?
Proper technological resources will ensure that your company will survive the competition. 
Developing a business technology plan will keep costs in check and meet your business technology needs.
Like a business plan, a technology plan will lay out a documented strategy for your company.
The technology decisions you make now will have significant financial and compatibility consequences further down the road. 
Planning ahead will eliminate redundancies, maximize your expansion capabilities, and save time and money.
Will help you ensure that your company’s technology plan is unique to the needs of your industry and business.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Mr. Fox, talking of technology, what are the issues on top of your mind? 
Chris Fox: First and foremost, consider how your business is currently using technology and how you might use it in the future. I recommend this quick guide to understand the salient aspects of Technology Planning.
Chris Fox: Businesses can use technology in many different ways. For example, you can use it for,
Record-keeping
Inventory control
Database management
Presentation design
Desktop publishing
Production management
Web-based activities
Plus, you can choose to use specialized technology applications in product manufacturing or service delivery.
Chris Fox: 
Identifying Appropriate Technology
Once you know how you will use technology, your next step is to choose equipment and software that will meet your needs:
Function, 
Compatibility
Cost
Ease of use
Expansion capability 
Find technological solutions that can be easily integrated with each other, both now and in the future. The technology you purchase should not be rendered obsolete right away, especially if it functions in a platform that is incompatible with other mainstream technology.
Unless your business requires highly customized technology solutions, it’s best to stick with well-known hardware and software brands rather than take a risk on a cheaper, more obscure manufacturer.
Chris Fox:
Allow for Advances in Technology
Like any business plan, a technology plan is a semi-fluid document. It can’t be so rigid that it won’t allow for modification and adaptation for technological advances. An overly rigid technology plan can have far-reaching consequences, which aren’t apparent to you right now.
For example, your company needs to purchase an expensive piece of technology to manufacture your products. Since cash is tight and the cost of the technology is enormous, you create a technology plan that ties you to that piece of technology for ten years because it allows you to spread payment for the equipment over a longer term.
However, in five years the technology completely changes. The competition is on board with the new technology while you’re stuck with the old technology for another five years, placing your business at competitive disadvantage.
With a little built-in flexibility, you can avoid similar nightmare scenarios and keep your company on track with technology and the marketplace. Remember, appropriate use of technology can make your business look established and successful from the very beginning!]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: That was a great insight, Mr. Fox! And with that, we come to the last topic for the day… Checklist for getting your business online.
Chris Fox: I cant emphasize the importance of checklists enough… Especially if you are planning to take your business online! Here’s a checklist for deciding what your business website should be able to do or it’s functionality. All of the items on this checklist require a fair degree of consideration, but you can drill down on any of them to find the information you need to make decisions.
Chris Fox: The benefits you get from a little up-front technology planning include:
Lower costs
Less development time
More control over your information systems
Stronger model for integrating online sales with your other business systems
Chris Fox: Completing the following list will yield a complete list of the hardware, software and services you need to launch your website:
Define the optimal visitor experience
Market research will help you identify the common browsers, modem speeds and other restraints in the computing power of your target market. This helps you avoid developing site technology that your customers don’t have the capabilities to use.
Evaluate the technology required to deliver your content
Content is a combination of text and graphics that showcases, merchandises and sells your product or service. Different kinds of content require different kinds of technology to serve to customers. Your designated site developer should be involved at this level, to define the customer experience as an integral part of defining the site requirements.
Plan to track prospects and customers through your site
Tracking your customer through your site is the equivalent of watching a customer evaluate your merchandise and interact with your sales force. Most ISPs and hosts provide some minor enhancements that let you analyze traffic trends on your site. 
Chris Fox: Define your order-processing needs
Your e-commerce software will be responsible for taking your customer’s order and transmitting it to you. You’ll have to decide whether you’ll accept credit cards online and a host of related decisions that will impact your technology investments.
Specify your site maintenance requirements
Your site maintenance requirements will vary depending upon the volumes of visitors or customers you expect to attract. You should know what it will take to keep your site running and consider these requirements when shopping for your hosting service.
Outline your website security
You must protect three significant areas of your information systems:
The transaction between you and your customer
Any information stored on your Web server, such as customer names, authorizations, or credit card account numbers
Any computer networks connected to your Web server, such as your internal business networks
Chris Fox: Define localization requirements
If you think your product or service has international appeal, you can save a lot of money by following simple guidelines for creating international-friendly content. You’ll need to consider not only language differences but cultural and — most important — currency differences, as well.
Prioritize community-building options
Communication among visitors to your site-often called “community” — is one of the main reasons customers revisit a site. A number of technologies are specifically devoted to making this communication possible. For example, these include chat, bulletin boards, ICQ and discussion lists. You may want to implement some or all of these.
Decide on your advertising display strategy
Over time, as you begin to occupy your market share, you become attractive to others who want to advertise on your site. Even if you have no intentions of selling advertising space to others, you might want to use banner advertising technologies on your site to communicate with your customers. Identify now, where and how you will accommodate advertising. Paid advertising on search engines is called pay-per-click and is a highly cost-effective way to build targeted online traffic.
Sally James: Thank you for that extensive checklist, Mr. Fox! It’s going to be a handy tool for our viewers. And now, before we end our program, let’s do the last quiz of this episode. ]]></TranscriptText>

Entrepreneur 1: Having a partner means you have two heads instead of one to discuss and make decisions. Clearly, there is safety in numbers. 
Entrepreneur 2: You don’t need to be at the business at all times. A partner means you have someone else who will be there to share the load and permit you to take a vacation and have sick time. 
Entrepreneur 3: You will also have a highly motivated co-worker, not just someone who is earning a paycheck.  
Entrepreneur 4: Partners are advantageous when they have complementary skills. 
Entrepreneur 5: A partner can contribute capital and share the risks when things do not proceed as planned.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: These entrepreneurs are in favor of going into business with a partner. Lets quickly recap why they feel that a partner is good for their business.
Reasons why having a partner is good for your business:
You have two heads instead of one when making decisions. 
You have someone to share the work load with.
You have a highly motivated co-worker, and not just someone who is earning a paycheck. 
A partner with complementary skills is advantageous . 
A partner can contribute capital and share the risk when things do not go as planned.
Sally James: After hearing the reasons in favor of having a business partner, lets find out why some people prefer running their business alone. 
Reasons why going alone is good for your business: 
You will have to share the rewards if the business is successful. 
You will lose total control over the business, particularly if you and your partner have difficulty in making decisions. 
You will have to share the recognition that will come if the business is successful. 
A partner can be a disaster if his or her judgment is not good. 
You run the risk of a falling out and perhaps the necessity of one partner buying the other out if dissention arises.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: We asked Mr. Fox, the winner of Business Person of the Year Award, to tell us the things that we need to consider before deciding to go into business alone or with a partner. And here’s what he had to say…
Mr. Fox: If you choose to start a business with a partner, you will have to decide if a particular person will make a good partner. You will need to consider if you have: 
similar work habits
similar objectives concerning how to run the business 
similar or complementary strong points. 
Different capabilities permit you to spread the workload and provide better coverage for problems. 
They may also permit you to give each partner a veto over important decisions in his or her area of expertise to help maintain stability and eliminate conflicts. 
Do consider whether you should have a buy-sell agreement in the event of a disagreement.
Also consider how the purchaser will pay for the portion of the business he or she is buying (and whether you should fund the buy-sell agreement with insurance in the event of the death of a partner). 
Sally James: We will take a quick break here. But stay right there because after the break we will be talking about which business organization is the best for you. And while we are gone, here’s a quick quiz coming up for you.

Some of you might be comfortable with Sole Proprietorship, some might find it easy to form a General Partnership.

Mr. Fox: Whether you are going it alone or with another person, it is best to consult a lawyer to determine which form of business organization will be best for you. 
Sally James: Lets look at each type of business organization to understand what it means for a start-up business.
Mr. Fox: A sole proprietorship is one person alone. He or she will have unlimited liability for all debts of the business, and the income or loss from the business will be reported on his or her personal income tax return along with all other income and expense he or she normally reports (although it will be on a separate schedule). Although proprietorship avoids the expense of forming a partnership or corporation, many start businesses this way because they are unfamiliar with the other forms of organizations. 
In a general partnership, each of the two or more partners will have unlimited liability for the debts of the business. The income and expense is reported on a separate return for tax purposes, but each partner then reports his or her pro-rata share of the profit or loss from the business as one line on his personal tax return. 
With a limited partnership, each of the general partners has unlimited liability for the debts of the partnership, but the limited partner's exposure to the debts of the partnership is limited to the contribution each has made to the partnership. With certain minor exceptions, the reporting for tax purposes is the same as for a general partnership. 
A corporation provides limited liability for the investors. Except as indicated below, none of the shareholders in a corporation is obligated for the debts of the corporation; creditors can look only to the corporation's assets for payment. The corporation files its own tax return and pays taxes on its income. If the corporation distributes some of its earnings in the form of dividends, it does not deduct the dividend in computing its taxes, but the shareholder recipients must pay taxes on those dividends even though the corporation has paid taxes on its earnings. A corporation has some tax benefits such as deductibility of health insurance premiums. 
A corporation that has made an election to be an "S" Corporation for federal income tax purposes is treated as a partnership for tax purposes, although it is treated as a regular corporation for other purposes. 
Limited Liability
Mr. Fox: Remember that there variations in these rules, and you should consult with your attorney and accountant in each specific case to determine what form of organization best fits your needs. 
Another thing to consider before making the final decision is that although a corporation has limited liability for its shareholders, if it does not have sufficient assets various creditors may insist on personal guarantees from the shareholders. 
For example, your landlord, some suppliers, and by law, liability for certain payroll taxes and liabilities to employees.  
Sally James: Thank you Mr. Fox! And before moving on to our next session, where we will discuss how professionals can help a business, take this quiz to determine your understanding of the different types of business organization.

Mr. Fox: Oh yes, small businesses are like any other business. There are many laws that are applicable to small business owners and entrepreneurs alike. 
Sally James: So, when you started out, how did you make sure that you complied with all the legal requirements? 
Mr. Fox: I discovered early that it is best to consult with professionals to find out which laws are applicable to my business, which permits I need to commence business, and where to go to comply with the various rules. 
Mr. Fox: As an entrepreneur, I needed the services of an attorney and an accountant.
An attorney assists in complying with:
Labor laws, such as the employment of minors, illegal aliens and workplace safety rules. 
Requirements for business licenses, including special licenses for particular businesses 
Building codes and permits for remodeling and zoning laws
Health department requirements 
Environmental laws. 
An accountant assists in filing: 
Income tax returns 
Franchise tax returns 
Employment tax returns 
The time for payment of withheld and employers share of employment taxes 
Unemployment tax returns and payment 
Sally James: For Sales Tax Reports and Payments, take a look at our Small Business Tax Center created in association with the I.R.S. ]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: To ensure that your business runs smoothly, you may need other professionals to help you too. 
Mr.Fox:
Attorney: Your attorney should:
Draw your partnership agreement or form your corporation, including the issuance of stock and appropriate filings with the Secretary of State and the Department of Corporations
Advise on the best form of ownership
Assist in negotiations to buy an existing business and review documents if you are buying a franchise
Advise on buy-sell agreements and draft appropriate documents
Review and approve your lease document, if you are renting an office, store or factory for your business. (A lease obligation can become your biggest liability, and your attorney can help negotiate fair and protective terms. For example, if you anticipate growth, your lease should include a provision for how expansion requirements will be handled.) 
Provide specialized legal advice to establish and protect your intellectual property rights. (Intellectual property includes your ownership rights to your business name, trademarks, copyrights and patents. Intellectual property law is a specialized field, and you may need an attorney who specializes in these matters.) 
Accountant: Your accountant can be an important advisor in start-up decisions, such as 
Deciding the appropriate division of the capital you contribute to a corporation between stock and loans. 
Determining the best form of ownership. 
Helping set up the books and records of the business. 
Advising computer needs for accounting purposes. 
Filing tax returns, advising on compensation of owners, preparing financial statements, helping forecast cash needs, including whether to expand, addition of employees and determining profitability. 
He or she will have a continuing role in 
filing tax returns
advising on compensation of owners
preparing financial statements
helping forecast cash needs including whether to expand, addition of employees
Determining whether you are really making money in this venture
Payroll Service Providers allow small businesses to outsource complex payroll issues at very low costs. 
There are many payroll service providers listed in the Yellow Pages and on the Internet (go to "payroll service providers" on search engines.) The two largest firms are Automatic Data Processing, Inc (ADP) and (Paychex). In recent years, payroll service providers have expanded their services to handle other personnel issues as well, such as managing retirement plans, workers compensation insurance and pre-employment verification. 
Payroll service providers incorporate services such as: 
401K and Simple IRA
Business Tax Protection & Payment
Health Insurance
Human Resources Help Desk
Human Resources Software
New Hire Reporting
Pay-by-Pay Workers Compensation Insurance 	     	
Payroll Tax Calculation, Deposit and Filing
Pre-Employment Screening/Background Checks
Reporting Solutions
State Unemployment Insurance Management
Time and Attendance Solutions
As a business owner, you can participate in the benefits of tax-deferred pension plans for yourself and your employees. Good pension planning will help you attract and keep good employees. Some payroll service providers now handle pension plan management. 
Your professionals can also be of significant assistance in helping formulate your business plan by advising on: 
The appropriate form of organization. 
Roles of each partner, such as the control of each party. 
The areas in which each will have primary responsibility and the ownership of each party. 
Good and bad terms of the proposed deal during acquisition of an existing business, and help negotiate with the seller and his or her attorney. 
Your need for capital, both at the inception of the business and additional capital required if the business is successful and you decide to expand. 
Pre-employment screening is especially important when you are starting because you don't have ongoing revenues to offset mistakes. Many start-ups skip screening because they're unfamiliar with it or don't know how to have it done at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, this can open them up to resume fraud among other undesirable possibilities. 
A good example of a reputable and inexpensive source for conducting background checks is Washington Research Associates at www.e-employmentscreening.net. 
Also, many tips on how to go about the hiring process can be found through search engines by entering "hiring tips." ]]></TranscriptText>

And if you're not sure about needing help on an issue, your investment in legal fees now can help you avoid much bigger problems at a later date. 
Today, we have with us, Mr. John Marshall, an eminent business lawyer with expertise in startups. He will discuss the essentials of the different licenses required for setting up your business, and also take questions from our viewers during the program.  
Sally James: Good evening Mr. Marshall! Welcome to Startup Entrepreneurs! As you know, today we are looking at a very crucial aspect of setting up a new business and its basic requirements – the licenses, permits and business names. And our viewers would like to know how to find a good lawyer to help them with these issues.
Mr. Marshall: Good evening! Thanking you for inviting, Sally!  I am here to orient the essence of setting up of a new business to all those who are watching this program. I’d like to suggest a good and relatively easy way to find a lawyer. Just ask for recommendations from your accountant or business acquaintances. ]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: To start off, some of our viewers also want to know if they really need any licenses?
Mr. Marshall: The answer most likely is ‘yes’. Without this, you may be conducting business illegally. Just about all businesses need a county or city license. There may be local, county, state, and or federal licensing requirements, depending on the type of business you select. 
Sally James: Lets look at each type of licenses and permits required for your business. 
Mr. Marshall: Local Licenses and Permits 
Your local licensing requirements will vary. Some examples of these variations are given as follows: 
You may need a zoning compliance permit before you can open your business. Make sure that the space you own or have taken on lease is properly zoned for the specific type of business you select. 
You may need a special license if you’re conducting business out of your house, a beauty salon for example. 
Are you planning on remodeling your space? You may need to get a permit, so you will want to check the building codes first.
State Licenses and Permits
There are certain businesses and professions that require a state license such as:
• Accountants • Building contractors  • Appraisers • Cosmetologists 	• Auctioneers • Private investigators • Barbers • Private security guards • Bill collectors • Real estate agents 
Your state may require you to have special licenses if you sell certain products such as firearms, gasoline, liquor, lottery tickets, etc. You can check with your local and state government to see if your business will require any special licenses. 
Federal Licenses and Permits
For a very small number of businesses, federal licensing is a basic requirement. In businesses that are highly regulated by the government, federal licensing is typically required. For example,
• Broadcasting 		• Manufacturing tobacco alcohol, or firearms 	• Drug manufacturing 	
• Preparing meat products 		• Ground transportation 	• Selling firearms 	• Investment advising]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Marshall: The best place to start with is your local city hall or courthouse. See the city clerk, who should be able to direct you. You can also phone the city or county clerk's office with questions, or look in your local phone book under municipal government offices. Try a search online for "Your city hall" on Google or Yahoo local searches to find the Web site for your local city hall. ]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: The next question is from the owner of a home-based business. She wants to know about license requirements when working from home.
Mr. Marshall: Investigate local zoning ordinances covering home-based businesses. Some residential neighborhoods have strict zoning restrictions that may prevent you from doing business out of your home. Yet, it may be possible to get a variance or conditional-use permit. 
In many areas, attitudes toward home based businesses are becoming more supportive, making it easier to obtain a variance. Even then condominiums and planned communities may have bylaws that could affect your ability to do business out of your home. 
Sally James: We will take a short break here. Take the quick quiz while we are gone.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Marshall: Yes. Most states require that you get a DBA. So that the business name legally belongs to you.
You will need a DBA if, You are a Sole Proprietor or a General Partnership operating your business under a fictitious and/or assumed name. You may need to apply for a DBA certificate in the county where the business is physically located. 
You want the name to legally belong to you, so you will be able to enforce any contracts you sign under your business name. 
If you want other businesses to know that you exist and prevent them from taking the name.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Mr. Marshall, would you also tell our viewers about the process of getting a DBA?
Mr. Marshall: Yes, I will. You will need to start by visiting your local county clerk's office to ask about the specific requirements and fees. They will often conduct a complimentary name search for the intended business name to make sure it's not already taken. 
But in some states, there are other requirements.
Process for Getting a DBA
Contact or visit your local county clerk's office and ask about the specific requirements and fees. Typically, there is a small registration fee. The county clerk's office will often conduct a complimentary name search for the intended business name to make sure it's not already taken. There are several online resources available to conduct searches on your intended business name as well.
Some states may require you to place a fictitious name notice in a local newspaper for specified period of time. The costs for this are usually small, and the newspaper may even file the necessary papers with the county. Consider checking with different local newspapers to see what they offer. 
For the majority of states, corporations are not required to file fictitious business names unless they do business under names other than their own. The incorporation documents have the same effect that fictitious names filed for partnerships and sole proprietorships do.

It is important to have a business bank account so that you can accept payments written out to your company name. 
Different banks have different requirements to set up a business account.  Also, find out what services they offer.

Mr. Marshall: Well, you are not required by law to do this. But registering your name as a trademark is always a good idea.
Registering Your Name As A Trademark
It provides you with protection in case another business tries to use your business name or a name that is likely to be confused with your business name. 
It may be smart to file an application for a federal trademark, if your company is doing business in several states. 
TIP: Run a search with the government or through a service to determine if your name is taken.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Back from the break, we will look at some other licenses and permits like the Seller’s Permit. What is a Seller’s Permit Mr. Marshall? 
Mr. Marshall: A seller's permit, which is also called as a "certificate of resale" or a "certificate of authority“, that lets you collect sales tax from your customers, which you in turn pay to the state. Of course, there are conditions to obtaining a Seller’s Permit.
Seller’s Permit / Certificate of Resale / Certificate of Authority
This permit lets you collect sales tax from your customers, which you in turn pay to the state. 
It is different from a business license. Are you engaging in retail sales? If the answer is "yes", then you probably need to register for and get a sales tax license or a seller's permit. 
You’d still need this permit if you are also selling goods that are exempted from state sales tax. If you are selling both products and services, it is important you keep sales organized separately. Sales of services are not usually taxed in most states. Sales tax is imposed at the retail level and will vary depending on your state.
Sally James: Where can we get a Seller’s Permit? 
Mr. Marshall: You can register for a sellers permit through state’s Board of Equalization, Sales Tax Commission, or Franchise Tax Board. The following is a useful link from the Irs.gov Web site to help you locate the appropriate offices in your state.
To locate the appropriate offices in your state to get a Seller’s Permit, go to Web site.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Marshall: EIN is also known as a federal tax ID. It is similar to a social security number for your business. This nine-digit number is important because it allows you to identify your business on important government forms and official documents. Often, the wholesale distributors require either a federal tax ID or a seller's permit from a retailer.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Mr. Marshall: Here are some pointers for those viewers who want to know if they need an EIN…
Get an EIN instead of using your social security number:
It is safer to give out your EIN than to give out your personal social security number. 
There is no fee for receiving this from the IRS. 
It can help you establish credibility with whom you do business.
Mr. Marshall: An EIN is required if,
Your business has employees. 
Your business is a Corporation or a Partnership. 
You file any of these tax returns: Employment, Excise or Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
You withhold taxes on income, other than wages, paid to a non-resident alien. 
You have a Keogh plan. 
You are involved with: trusts, IRAs, exempt organization, business income tax returns, estates, real estate mortgage investment conduits, non-profit organizations, and farmers' cooperatives or plan administrators. 
TIP: If you provide health insurance for your employees, you may need a National Standard Employer Identifier (NSEI) for your electronic health transactions.
Sally James: That was very useful Marshall! But how do we apply for an EIN?
Mr. Marshall: Fortunately, the Internal Revenue Service makes the process very easy. You can apply by phone, fax, mail, or online. 
Also remember that your business may need to acquire a tax identification number from your states department of revenue or taxation.

Sally James: In this episode, we will look at Insurance Coverage for Small Businesses, specifically:
Business property insurance
Liability insurance 
Worker's compensation insurance 
Other insurance coverage 
Excess liability coverage 
Employment practices liability coverage 
Life insurance 
Sally James: As a budding entrepreneur, do you feel that business insurance is an expense you cannot afford? That it is a luxury for big and thriving companies? Nothing could be farther from the truth! Insurance is an important part of any enterprise, irrespective of how huge or small they are. 
And to find out why, we will go straight to Mr. Arthur Holbrook, who is an expert in small business insurance. He will discuss the essentials of small business insurance, and also take questions from our viewers during the program. ]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Good evening Mr. Holbrook! Welcome to  the program, “Startup Entrepreneurs!” Today, we are going to take a close look at how important business insurance is for new enterprises. 
Yet, we often find that most new entrepreneurs tend to put insurance on the back burner. Why is  it so? 
Mr. Holbrook : That's true. Over the years, I have observed that in the beginning when budding entrepreneurs are busy with the setting up of their enterprise or are in search of funding and licenses, small business insurance usually takes a back step.
Sally James: That’s quite understandable. Given the tight budgets that most entrepreneurs work with, every buck counts. I recall what a viewer once told me. She said, the payment of a premium was another add-on to her expense list!
Mr. Holbrook : It’s an expense alright. But the purpose of insurance is to transfer a risk that you can afford. The risk here is that the payment of a premium has no guarantee of its return. But, and this is important… it covers a risk you cannot afford. For example, what homeowner does not insure his or her personal residence from damage by fire? 
Insurance is not only going to be important to you, but it will be important to your other business relationships. For example, if you choose to lease office space, the landlord will typically require that you furnish a certificate of insurance or be listed as an additional insured on your policy as assurance that your business will not disappear overnight in the event a loss occurs.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Okay. And to get the small business insured, entrepreneurs must hire another professional besides their attorney and accountant. Is that right?
Mr. Holbrook: Yes. An insurance agent can handle all of your insurance needs, and advise you on different policies that are specifically designed to cover small businesses that, in one package, will cover most of your insurance needs. 
Sally James: Mr. Holbrook, could you elaborate on the different risks that one would normally want covered by insurance?
Business Property Insurance 
Property insurance should include a broad form of coverage to protect you from a wide variety of losses. Your insurance should include: 
Buildings: Coverage would be required here, if you own the building your business occupies. In the event you take premises on lease, your landlord should provide this coverage. 
Business personal property: E.g., tables, desks, chairs and equipment. Also, you will want to include the tenant's improvements you might make to leased premises. E.g., a room divider, or a custom built counter that  you add  in the reception area for your clients. 
Loss of Income       • Earthquake     • Flood (which may/may not be available) 
TIP: An all-risk policy can be structured to cover all of your equipments, including computer hardware and software, plus your valuable records. A properly written policy will include loss of income that might result from breakdowns, as well as loss of income from other hazards that would temporarily close down your business. 
This case study illustrates how having a small business insurance is essential even for home-based entrepreneurs. 
Alicia is an interior designer. She runs her business from home, visiting clients at their homes. 
Today, she met a client in their home in the morning to better understand the lighting conditions. Next, she has to give a presentation to a prospect on revamping their office. On her way, she stops at a restaurant for a quick bite. While waiting for her food, she decides to review her presentation. Unfortunately, a waiter trips and spills coffee on her laptop. 
Luckily, Alicia has a Business Insurance, so her laptop is covered. 
Liability Insurance 
Comprehensive General Liability (CGL) policy is designed to provide coverage to third parties for:
• Personal and Advertising Injury 
• Fire Legal Liability, (often mandatory if you lease your premises) protects you in the event your negligence results in damage or loss to your landlord's property. 
• Fire Legal Liability protects your investment in: 
• Products and Completed Operations 
• Medical Expense or Medical Payments 
• General Liability for your premises. The best illustration is the common "tripping over the torn carpet, resulting in an injury" loss. 
TIP: Some policies will exclude Products and Completed Operations and/or Personal Injury and Advertising Coverage depending on the services your business provides. In these instances, a Professional Liability, Malpractice or Errors and Omissions Policy might be available for your type of operation that will cover the errors and omissions that might result in suits against your company. This is particularly true of professions that are held to a higher degree of care or standard, for example, attorneys, engineering consultants, insurance agents, realtors, doctors and dentists. 
This case study illustrates how having a General Liability Insurance is essential, especially for professions that are held to a higher degree of care or standard.
Dr. Edward Hudson has recently moved his practice into new premises. One day, he mistakenly leaves a small electric space heater running and goes home for the evening. During the night, the heater shorts and starts a fire. The fire and smoke causes considerable damage to the landlord's building. Since the negligent act of leaving the space heater caused the loss, Dr. Hudson will be sued by the landlord. 
Thanks to the Liability Insurance, Dr. Hudson is covered for the damage.
Worker's Compensation Insurance 
If your business has employees, worker's compensation insurance is mandatory. 
Start-up operations generally find that the State Compensation Fund can accommodate your needs. As the business grows, you can then "shop" for better prices for the coverage. 
Plus, some worker's compensation insurers provide additional services such as risk management and loss control services that may be beneficial to your business operation. These services are typically helpful in holding down claim costs over the long term. 
TIP: Do not confuse risk management with your taking part of the risk. The insurance company should assume 100 percent of the worker's compensation insurance risks. 
This case study illustrates how having a Worker's Compensation Insurance is essential for entrepreneurs who have employees working for them. 
Bret Johnson is the owner of a fitness center. 
Recently, one of the fitness trainers at the center suffered serious injury when a client accidentally dropped a weight on his right hand during training. After surgery, doctors advised him to discontinue fitness training. Since, he knew no other way to make a living, the injured employee filed for Workers’ Compensation for his lost income and to pay for his medical expenses.
Fortunately, Bret is covered under the Workers' Compensation Act. 
Other Insurance 
• Auto coverage for company vehicles. (Liability, Comprehensive, Collision and Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists.) 
• Health insurance plans tailored to fit the size of your business. This coverage will help give you an edge when recruiting good employees. 
• Here's a type of insurance you might not think about: when you're not there--and when only your answers will do, it is good idea to have a guide prepared for your employees to know what-to-do, who-to-call and where-to-find-it information so as to maintain the consistency of your business. 
This case study illustrates how having an Auto Insurance is helpful for small business owners with limited resources. 
Mary Lynden is the owner of a small cake shop where she sells designer cup cakes. She drives out to the shop every morning, which is on the other side of the town in her 2009 Chevy. On Monday, on her way to the shop, the engine of the car caught fire. Mary jumped out of the car and saved herself. But she broke her arm, and the car was completely destroyed by the fire. 
Fortunately, her auto insurance will meet the cost of replacing the car. 
Excess Liability Coverage 
These are liability limits available over and above the maximum limit your carrier of choice may write. They can be accomplished in two ways: 
Excess limits can typically be added at extra cost to the underlying package policy in "chunks" of $500,000 or $1 million dollar layers sometimes up to $5 million. 
Purchasing what is called as a  "commercial umbrella“. This can typically provide excess coverage over and above most underlying package policies, including the business policy, business auto, and worker's compensation. 
TIP: Your carrier of choice may offer lower limits, which may look attractive from a premium standpoint. But savvy business owners should contemplate liability limits of at least one million dollars. The additional cost is usually affordable and, in today's litigious environment, it makes good sense. 
This case study illustrates how Excess Liability Coverage safeguards small business owners with limited liability. 
Dan Watts runs a luxury car rental service. Last winter, while driving his customers to a wedding, his limousine skidded and two of the passengers in it suffered neck injuries.
They sued Dan for damages, and the judge ruled that he is at fault. This type of loss could easily result in a multi-million dollar judgment against you. 
Luckily, Dan was covered for excess liability.
Employment Practices Liability Coverage 
Employment Practices Liability insurance is a relatively new form of liability coverage that is starting to be carried by more companies, with premiums exceeding $2,000 annually for $1 million of coverage. 
While employment practice liabilities are rarely encountered in a small operation, as your company begins to grow and you hire more employees, threat of wrongful termination or sexual harassment lawsuits, or discrimination (age, sex, race, disability, etc.) become more prevalent as the size of your organization grows. 
Excluded under most business policies, it provides you protection against employee suits for employment-related allegations and other claims.
This case study illustrates how Employment Practices Liability Coverage safeguards small startups against employment practices. 
When Rita Sunder, a teacher, started a preschool, she hired a teaching assistant to help her. Two years later, the school is doing well, and Rita must hire an experienced teacher with preschool specialty. Keeping the costs in mind, she must let go of the teaching assistant.
But her assistant of two years sues her, alleging wrongful termination claiming that she should have been offered the new position. 
It only helps that Rita is covered for Employment Practices Liability. 
Life Insurance 
If your startup is a partnership, is your business prepared in the event of the death of a partner? Or how the business will continue in such an event? 
Many business partners have a buy-sell agreement which allows the surviving partner to purchase the shares from the deceased owner’s estate. The question is how will you fund the buy-sell agreement? Do you:
Take the money from your saving?
Borrow the funds from a bank?
Sell your assets?
Purchase life insurance to cover the funds needed?
TIP: As your business grows, this insurance can be increased. 
This case study illustrates how if one partner dies, the surviving partner can receive life insurance and proceeds to use them to purchase the deceased’s shares. 
Philip and Harry are equal partners in a construction company. With the boom in real estate market, their construction business is on a roll. Then one day, Philip has an accident on a construction site and dies. Sheena, Philip's widow has no interest in joining the business and would like to sell Philip's share in the venture - to Harry or to any other investor who can fund the buy out. 
Based on financial statements, the company is worth $400,000 today. And Harry must generate $200,000 to take over Philip's share. Since, each partner had been insured as a cost-effective way to fund the buy-sell agreement, Harry has no problems. 
Sally James: Thank you Mr. Holbrook for the in-depth information on different policies that small businesses can benefit from! We will take a break here before we look at the Top Ten Do’s and Don’ts.
And while we are gone, here’s a Quick Quiz coming up for our viewers!]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Before you share the Do’s and Don'ts of small business insurance with our viewers, could you tell them how to get the right insurance broker for their business?
Arthur Holbrook: The key is to collect referrals to and references about lawyers, accountants and insurance agents before you start up. So you can select the most appropriate professional advisors well before the time you will need their services. 
Another aspect is that, perhaps they will provide you with initial free consultations for considering them as members of your professional team. 
Three large and reliable insurance companies that handle insurance for small businesses are STATE FARM, THE HARTFORD and ALLSTATE.

We asked Mr. Fox to share his experience in Business Location and Leasing with us.
Sally James: Good evening Mr. Fox! Welcome back to the programme ‘Startup Entrepreneurs!’ Today we are talking about the importance of location in the success of a business.
Mr. Fox: Location is an important consideration for any business. An initial step in business is selecting where you will live and where your business will be located. You may have the opportunity to relocate to an area where you would really enjoy living and working.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: It’s true that where you open your business can impact your success. There are various zoning categories that an entrepreneur must comply with. 
Mr. Fox: Yes, zoning categories are an important factor. Because every city has a planning department at City Hall. 
You will be dealing with this and other municipal departments and agencies that have discretionary authority to approve or disapprove your intended plans. 
1. You can no longer rely on zoning codes to determine what the rules are in your desired location. Because your intended location will often be subject to "precise plan" approval; an environmental impact assessment and other regulatory issues. 
2. You may have to appear before a review board that can often seem unreasonable in its decisions. Many cities have redevelopment agencies authorized to impose conditions even more stringent than those established by local codes. 
3. If unreasonable conditions make a location for your business unattractive, you should unemotionally look for another location.]]></TranscriptText>

• Room for future expansion 
• Convenient for employees 
• Good Accessibility 
• Available labor force 
• Appropriate utilities 
• Convenient to freight and express delivery systems]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Another important business category is the retail segment. Do they also have zoning criteria?
Mr. Fox: Each retail and commercial business has its own criteria. For example, a donut shop should be located on the "going-to-work" side of the street. On the other hand, a liquor store should be on the side of the street with traffic going home from work. The selection of your first location will have an overwhelming impact on your chances for success. 
In Session 1, you analyzed businesses that are similar to the one you chose. Did you analyze where they were located and why? 
Which one of the following retail businesses are most likely to succeed due to location?
1. Joanna opened her flower shop on the street front near a residential area. It was booked with orders from day 1!
2. Harris’ coffee shop is a popular place for the city residents. It is located in an area with a high pedestrian traffic area near the city lake. 
3. Paul started a Laundromat in a shop in a posh business center in the industrial area. But it isn’t doing well as he had expected it to.
4. Chelsea ‘s designer boutique is located right next to her competitor’s store. Buyers who visit the next shop also check out Chelsea’s designs.
5. With quick access and plenty of parking, Damien’s toy store is a hit with mothers, who can easily drive in with their kids and drive out. 
6. Matt’s liquor store has high visibility, being located on the corner of boulevard next to a chain of stores with high traffic.
Criteria for retail businesses  
1. Select the appropriate type of center (mall, strip, or mini). Some business do best in a large center, but some like Mini-Marts, Liquor stores and Laundromats do better in much smaller centers. Others such as florist, nursery or antique stores do well located on the street front. 
2. Demographic data will provide you with information about the neighborhood. It will inform you about the population, the number of households, estimated population by race, age and income level within a one, two, or five-mile radius. You can find firms that update this information on the Internet. A good place to start with is the International Council of Shopping Centers at www.icsc.org/srch/rsrch/demographics/. 
3. Walk and talk the area. You will be surprised how much you can learn by talking to customers, employees, and owners. 
4. Traffic count is very important because it will give you the number of cars travelling through the intersection. You can also get the pedestrian count, which is great for drop-in or walk-in business. This report can be obtained from the local traffic department. 
5. Visibility and signage: Customers must know you are there. They should be able to see your store. Usually, the end or corner location is better, which is why the rent for those spaces is higher. Get the biggest sign you can. Tell the public clearly what you are selling. Examples: Travel, Gifts, Pets etc. Both, your lease and the city ordinances, will have limitations regarding your signs. 
6. Access and parking: Be sure you have adequate and convenient parking area. Avoid streets with dividers or one-way traffic. Customers prefer stores where the parking is in the front of the store.  
7. Proximity to competition: Know where your competitors are located. You can get the names and the address from the internet search engines or if you are old school the Yellow Pages. Find out what your competition is doing and how they are doing it.
8. Generators (anchors): These are the big national stores in a mall or shopping center. For example, Albertson's, Nordstrom, Wal-Mart and/or McDonald's will help to bring customers into the center. The closer your business can be to generators, the easier it is for your business to thrive.]]></TranscriptText>

Mr. Fox: To start with, I’d recommend consulting a real estate lawyer to assist you in negotiating your lease or purchase. 
That’s because a five-year lease on a $1,000 per month space is $60,000 (probably a personal obligation) and may well be your largest obligation for your beginning business. 
Mr. Fox: Next, I’d find out the estimated cost per month before signing the lease. 
Most retail stores leases are Net, Net, Net (NNN) leases (Triple Net Lease). That means, you as the tenant will pay for the taxes, insurance, gardening, utilities, security, trash and sewer, litter, graffiti removal, and repairs. This charge is based on the square footage of your space. 
CAM (Common Area Maintenance) charges can be costly. They can vary but will normally include parking lot sweeping and repair and all aspects of common area upkeep. 
Sally James: We have a question here from a viewer! This entrepreneur wants to know what happens if he rents a space on lease for five years. And a year later, he needs a larger space?  
Mr. Fox: That’s a big possibility! Many start-up businesses find their growth rate is more rapid than they expected it to be. So, ask for options. 
And try to keep your initial term short. At the end of your base term, you can renew the lease or move. There are reasons to have a short-term lease with options: 
1) Your business may not be successful at your initial location. A short-term lease will minimize your overall rent obligation. 
2) You need flexibility in lease terms to accommodate growth. 
Sally James: What happens if a short term lease is not possible? How do you plan for expansion and growth?
Mr. Fox: An entrepreneur must always consider the possibility that you need to expand your business and will need more space in the near future. 
To provide a solution for this, you can extend your lease for a longer period of time; your space can be expanded; you can move to another location in the center, or you can cancel your lease. 
Mr. Fox: There is no such thing as the last good location. And most importantly, don't hurry your decision. 
Sally James: That's a useful checklist, Mr. Fox. Are there any other points to consider before signing a lease or purchasing a property?
Mr. Fox: Ask these three questions before signing a lease or purchasing a property, 
1) Is the location the best available in the area where you want to be located? 
2) Does it meet your own specific criteria? 
3) Are utilities and tenant improvements adequate? 
Sally James: And entrepreneurs who’ve decided to lease a property, go through the basic leave provisions. 
Mr. Fox: 
Rent: Is the rent comparable to other rents in the same location? 
Term: Is your lease for a short-term (a year or less) or long-term? 
Floor area: How much square footage is included in the space? Rent and CAM charges are based on the square footage of your space. 
Common area maintenance charges (CAM): What are the estimated charges for a year? 
Options: Do you have options to renew the lease after the first term expires? 
Rent increase: Is it a fixed rent increase or is it based on the CPI (Consumer Price Index). If it is the CPI, negotiate a percentage cap. 
Percentage rent: Some landlords will ask for fixed rent plus a percentage (of your sales). This is negotiable. 
Tenant improvements: Put in writing the responsibilities of the landlord and your responsibilities to do the necessary improvements to get the space open for business. Landlord's Construction Exhibit "C" should be made a part of the lease. Please refer to the sample exhibit furnished in this session. 
Right to assign or sublet: Landlord's consent "not to be unreasonably withheld." 
Signs: Be specific with exhibit and description. 
Provision for expansion requirements: If you think your business will be expanding, make necessary provisions in your lease agreement to provide for anticipated future needs. 
Parking rights: Be sure that adequate parking space is provided. In most retail centers, tenants share "common area parking" rights. Nearby restaurants or theaters can monopolize the parking space you require. 
Personal guarantee: You should avoid this, if possible. If it is required, ask your lawyer to review this clause carefully. 
Exclusive: Ask that no other business similar to yours be allowed in the center if it's appropriate.

Mr. Fox: For start-ups, the primary consideration is arrangement of capital, which is the basic need to start up the business. 
• Are requirements going to change? If so, renting is probably preferable. 
• Are there tax or borrowing incentives available, if you buy the property? 
• Some make more on the real estate than on the business. Talk to the Community Development Department. 
• Ownership fixes future cost and availability of the location. 
Sally James: That was exhaustive! Before we move on to discussing the homework you should do prior to leasing, we will take another short break. Take the quiz ]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Mr. Fox, one of the questions that our viewers have repeatedly asked is, if there is a methodical approach for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each potential location.
Mr. Fox: Yes. You can evaluate potential site locations by creating your own "Site Model" that helps to maintain objectivity when evaluating locations for your business. 
You can do this by assigning different values to the factors that are most important for your particular business. 
You can then evaluate each location against these measurements. 
Some things to keep in mind in site selection: 
There's no such thing as the "last good location." 
Copycatting your most successful competitor's site criteria can help you avoid making mistakes. 
If you are building a chain of stores, never sign a lease on your second location until your first location is profitable and proven. 
It is better to pay fair rent on a great location than to pay great rent on a fair location. 
Don't rely on leasing agents to make your site decisions. 
Driving streets and walking neighborhoods is a good way to scout for locations.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Can you explain how to use that form, Mr. Fox?
Mr. Fox: Well, here’s how it works:
1. Evaluate your site location for each factor on a scale of 1 to 10, Number 10 being the highest. 
2. Decide the importance of each factor to your particular business on a scale of 1 to 5, Number 5 being the most important. 
3. Multiply the grade by the weight to determine the points for each factor. Add up the points to get a total score. Repeat this process for each site to gain an objective as well as comparative analysis. 
Sally James: Thank you Mr. Fox. That was very useful.
And now we will take a look at the top ten do’s and don’ts when leasing or purchasing  property.
DO’S
Talk to your city hall planning and zoning department to ensure that your intended location conforms to all code requirements. 
Create a Site Model Criteria for your particular business. 
Look at many locations to establish comparable values for rent and location potential. 
Order demographic data to provide information about your customers. 
Retain a real estate lawyer to assist in negotiating your lease or purchase. 
To minimize your risk, negotiate for a short-term lease with options. 
Provide terms in your lease for potential expansion requirements. 
Have every agreement put into writing. 
Ask that no similar business be allowed in your shopping center. 
Use signs that are the largest allowed and clearly stated what you are selling. 
DON’TS
Be hasty in making a real estate decision. (There is no such thing as the last good location.) 
Don't judge a location entirely on rent. 
Permit a potential landlord to dictate all the lease terms. 
Personally guarantee your lease, if possible. 
Sign a purchase or lease document without the approval of your lawyer. 
Depend on the advice of a landlord's leasing agent. 
Submit to unreasonable conditions; unemotionally look for another location. 
Depend on any verbal agreements with landlords or sellers-get it in writing. 
Open the second store until the first one is proven and profitable. 
Sign a lease without the condition that it is subject to securing all permits and licenses.]]></TranscriptText>

John:  That’s correct.
Sally: How is this information prepared? 
John: This information is prepared in three steps: identification, recording, and communication.
Sally James: Roll the mouse over each step to learn more about the three critical steps involved in preparing financial information.
John:Economic events are identified. A sale at a gas station, payment of taxes by a commercial enterprise, or purchase of insurance are all examples of economic events.
All economic events are recorded. Recording is done to provide the historyof a company’s financial activities. In this step, economic events are also classified and summarized.
Information about classified and summarized economic events is communicated to interested parties. Such communication may take several forms. One of them is financial statements.]]></TranscriptText>

John: Sure.
John: Please refer to the illustration on the right to understand the connection between types of accounting and accounting information users. 
Sally: Click each box to learn more about the connection between financial information types and its users. 
John: Financial accounting provides information that is designed to satisfy the needs of external users. 
Such reporting is usually done in the form of financial statements.
John: Managerial accounting provides information that is useful for internal users to run a company’s operations. Such reporting is usually accomplished through the custom designed reports.
John: External users are the parties outside the reporting entity (company) who are interested in the accounting information.
John: Internal users are the parties inside the reporting entity (company) who are interested in the accounting information.
John: Investors (owners) use the accounting information to make buy, sell, or make decisions related to shares, bonds, etc.
John: Creditors (suppliers, banks) utilize the accounting information to make the lending decisions.
John: Customers may need the accounting information to decide what products to buy and from which company. 
John: Tax authorities (Internal Revenue Service) need the accounting information to determine a company’s tax liabilities.
John: A company’s senior and middle management uses the accounting information to run the business.
John: Employees utilize the accounting information to determine a company’s profitability and profit sharing.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: That was all about the accounting information. Now let’s move on to the next topic of this segment, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 
Sally James: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given legal authority; generally known as accounting standards. Am I correct, John?  
John : You are absolutely right! People and organizations make decisions based on financial information prepared by accountants. That is why it is important for these people and organizations to understand how accounting information is measured.  
John: To facilitate communication, rules are established that business people can use to ensure when they compare oranges to oranges. Let’s see an example.
For example, assume a store sells goods. 
The question may arise, when should an accountant record the sale — at the moment the goods are shipped which is called as accrual accounting or at the time cash for these goods is received which is called as cash accounting? 
John: (bubble:2) Whether the store owner applies the accrual or cash accounting is not important as long as a third rule is established requiring the owner to disclose the method selected for the reporting purposes.
John: Here’s some more information about GAAP, which will be useful for you.
Accounting rules in the USA are grouped and called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are common standards that indicate how to report economic events.
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issues Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) that comprise a large portion of GAAP. 
You can find more information about SFAS, their issuance process and the current projects on FASB’s website.
Other organizations playing a significant role in regulating the accounting profession are Securities and Exchange Commission and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
The last two mostly regulate public companies, while the first one establishes standards for private companies.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Now let’s talk about the methods of accounting. Before you start, you will need to decide what form of accounting your business will require. What are these forms? Let’s hear from John.
John: There are two methods of accounting:
Cash basis method
Accrual method
John: Let’s first understand what is Cash basis method.
This is what the name implies; you recognize “income” when you receive the cash and you recognize “expense” when you pay the bill.
John: And the second method is Accrual method.
In this method, you match revenue with expenses regardless when the actual cash may or may not be collected. If you sell a product to a customer and she doesn’t pay you for 30 days, the sales is recorded in the books on the day you made the sale. When the money comes in the “accounts receivable” is then turned into cash which is normally deposited into the bank. The same is also true when considering expenses; if you incur an expense in one month but don’t pay until the next month, the expense will be recognized in the month in which you incurred the expense. The Internal Revenue Service generally requires businesses to use the accrual method of accounting.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Now let’s talk about internal controls. For a secured business accounting, you need to have strong internal controls. “Internal controls” refers to what is needed in the handling of funds, where money in the form of cash, checks, or credit cards is exchanged for goods and services. The goal is to make sure that the business receives all of its income without any of it being siphoned off by waste, fraud, dishonest employees, or just through carelessness. Right John?
John: That’s true Sally. Even a business that is healthy in all other respects can be very much vulnerable to failing due to lack of internal controls.
John: If you are in a manufacturing or retail business, you will need to set up inventory policies and controls because inventory, similar to cash, can disappear very rapidly through carelessness or employee dishonesty.
Sally James: And for this to happen, you will need to have safeguards in place. It may help in monitoring the internal activities as to who can sign for goods, services and who can control the release of goods and services outdoor after the processing has been completed. 
John: Exactly!
Sally James: This was all about Basics of Accounting. Before we move on to our next segment, here’s a Quick Quiz coming up for our audience.]]></TranscriptText>

The central means of external financial reporting is a set of financial statements. The four general-purpose financial statements are: Income Statement, Statement of Changes in Equity, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flows
Alicia: Your business will be judged by the three classic financial measures: the balance sheet, the profit and loss statement, and the cash flow statement. These three measurements will define the financial health of your company.
The three classic financial measures are: 
The Balance Sheet: The balance sheet shows how much the business is worth.
The Profit and Loss Statement: The profit and loss statement indicates whether your business is profitable or not. 
The Cash Flow Statement: The cash flow statement predicts your cash balances into the future.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: If I am not wrong, all financial statements comprise of several elements. What are these and how many are they?
Alicia: Yes you are right and these elements are the building blocks with which financial statements are constructed. Their main focus is on the items related to measuring performance and reporting financial position.
Alicia: There are total ten elements: assets, liabilities, equity, contributed capital, revenue, expenses, distributions, net income, gains, and losses. Let’s understand them one by one.
Click the Next arrow to learn about the elements of financial statements.
Assets are the economic recourses of a business used to accomplish its main goal, i.e., increase owners’ wealth. To be formally recognized as an asset, the following two conditions must be met: 
The potential economic benefit must be assignable to a particular entity, and
The event giving rise to the assignment must have already occurred.
For example, if a company has purchased a piece of equipment and uses it in generating profits, it is considered as an asset. However, if the company just considers buying new equipment, it can’t be deemed or recorded as an asset. 
A company’s assets belong to the resource providers who are said to have claims on the assets. In other words, each asset has its own source provided by an owner or creditor. So, there can’t be any claim without an appropriate asset and vice versa.
Liabilities are the debts and the obligations of a company.
Equity is what the company “owes” to the owners. If a company goes bankrupt, liabilities are paid off first to the creditors, while equity is the last to be distributed. Therefore, owners’ equity is also called as residual equity.
Equity is usually viewed as a source of assets, and that’s why it becomes necessary to subdivide the owners’ interest into two components. 
First, owners’ claims are established when a business acquires assets from owners. These claims result from the contributions of capital resources by the owners, and therefore they are frequently called contributed capital.
Contributed capital is a component of equity resulting from the contributions of the capital resources from the owners.
The second source of assets associated with the equity occurs when a business obtains assets through its earning activities, and therefore it is called as retained earnings or gains. Retained earnings form a component of the equity resulting from the earnings activities. 
Distribution is the way in which the equity is distributed amongst the various stock-holders.
Assets acquired in operating activities are called revenues.  
Assets used in the process of generating revenues are called expenses. Expenses decrease retained earnings.
Asset used in the transactions result in a decrease in an asset account and in one of the claim accounts (liability or equity accounts).
The difference between revenues and expenses is called net income (if revenue is greater than expenses) or a net loss (if vice versa).
Net income is the excess of asset increases (revenues) and asset decreases (expenses) for a period. 
Net loss is the opposite of the net income. Net loss results from the excess of asset decreases (expenses) the over asset increases (revenues) for a period.]]></TranscriptText>

Alicia: The income statement is a summary of a company’s income, producing activities over a specific period of time. Income statements are also sometimes called the statement of profit and loss (or the P&L).
Alicia: Although there will be some minor changes in the presentation, income statements have some things in common.
Revenue
This number is always presented at the top, before any other expenses are listed.
Cost of goods sold (COGS)
This expense is always shown next. COGS is the cost of the products that were sold during the period (i.e., the items for which you received the revenue). If a company sells services instead of goods, there will be no line item for cost of goods sold.
The total for the gross margin line = revenue – cost of goods sold.
In all cases, the gross margin should be a positive number, because it reflects only the cost of the product you sell.
For example if you sold 100 gadgets at $4.75 each, for which you paid $2.15, your revenue would be $475, and your cost of goods sold would be $215, leaving you with a gross margin of $260.
The only way that the gross margin would be negative would be if you were selling goods for less than your cost to purchase or manufacture them. As a word of caution, you may not stay in business very long doing that! 
Expenses
Some income statements do not categorize expenses, However those that do usually separate them into sales such as administrative, and general expenses. 
Sales expenses are those which costs directly related to the sales process: 
your marketing manager’s salary, 
advertising, and
promotion. 
Administrative expenses would include: 
the costs of your premises (rent), 
receptionist’s salary, 
office supplies, and 
anything else necessary to your “back office” operations. 
The general expenses category is the catch-all basin for everything else.
Earnings before income tax (EBIT)
EBIT will be the figure you are left with once you total your expenses, then deduct them from your gross margin. 
EBIT shows your total net profit before your income tax expense for the period it is calculated. However, the EBIT number may be different than the number that you are taxed on in your income tax returns for a number of reasons (a discussion of which is beyond the scope of this lesson and not required at this stage). 
If a company is not incorporated, there will be no EBIT, because there will be no income taxes shown. An unincorporated company is not the subject to its own taxes; rather its owners are taxed on the company’s earnings as a part of their personal taxes.
Income taxes
As discussed above, this figure will appear only on a corporation’s income statement. The income tax expense represents the tax expense related to the current period (listed at the top of the income statement). It may or may not be different from the income tax payable figure on the balance sheet. 
The income statement is like a history book, presenting to you the story of what’s happened to your business over a specific period. That period will be shown near the top of the statement, where you’ll place the phrase, “For the year ended xxx,” or something similar. This phrase allows you to quickly identify in which period the revenues and expenses occurred.
The income statement measures the change in the net assets or the difference between assets increases and assets decreases. The asset increases from the operating activities are labeled ‘revenues.’ The asset decreases are called ‘expenses.’ The difference between revenues and expenses is called net income (if revenue is greater than expenses) or a net loss (if vice versa).]]></TranscriptText>

Alicia: Sally, let’s first understand what balance sheet is. Balance sheet is a financial statement that sums up a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. It reflects the structure of the company’s assets and financing sources used to finance these assets as of a particular date (i.e. as of year ended).
Alicia: If we refer to the Accounting Equation, where: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. The Balance Sheet reflects the same principle, i.e. one side of the Balance Sheet represents Assets and the other side, Liabilities and Equity. There must be a balance between the total value of the Assets and the total value of Liabilities and Equity. These three balance sheet segments help investors to decide as to what the company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by the investors.
Alicia: Let’s understand these three segments of balance sheet in details.
Click the Next arrow to learn about segments of a balance sheet.
Assets are the properties (can be material, immaterial, and monetary) owned by the entity, i.e. any physical thing (tangible) or right (intangible) that has a monetary value. 
Assets usually are divided into:
Current Assets:  Cash and other assets that may reasonably be expected to realized in cash or sold or used within period less or equal to one year.
Examples: inventory, cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses 
Long-term Assets: Used by the entity for a period longer than one year. 
Examples: long-term investments, fixed assets, intangible long-term assets.
Liabilities are debts owed to the outsiders, i.e. creditors. 
Liabilities are divided into:
Current Liabilities, which are due within one year (accounts payable, salaries payable, taxes payable, and interest payable)
Long-term Liabilities which are due after one year.
Alicia: 
Equity includes the amounts invested in a business by owners, special kind of liability residual claim against assets of business after total liabilities are deducted. 
Includes Share Capital (financial means invested by the shareholders) and Retained Earnings (net income retained in the business).]]></TranscriptText>

Alicia: Sure. That’s a good idea. 
Alicia: The statement of changes in equity explains the effects of transactions on the owner’s equity during an accounting period. The statement includes the beginning and the ending balances of contributed capital and reflects any new capital acquisitions made during the accounting period. The statement also shows the portion of net earnings retained in the business.]]></TranscriptText>

The statement of cash flow explains how the company obtained and used cash during a period. 
Sources of cash are called cash inflows. Cash inflows are sources of cash; for example, payments from customers, proceeds from bank loans etc. 
Use of cash are known as cash outflows. Cash outflows are uses of cash; for example, payments to vendors, paying off bank loans, etc.
Alicia: The statement classifies cash inflows and outflows into three categories:
Operating activities section explains cash generated through revenue and cash spent for expenses.
Investing activities include cash received or spent on the productive assets and investments in the debt or equity of other companies.
Financing activities describe cash transactions associated with the resource providers (i.e., owners and lenders).]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Bank transactions is the most important and day-to-day activity for any company. Alicia, will you please explain us about the process and documents required in this transactions.
Alicia: Sure, let’s start with understanding the process. 
Alicia: All the transactions made by the company are not only noted in the company’s cash book account, but also they get recorded by the bank. 
Alicia: The bank usually mails a statement to the company. This bank statement lists all the activities in the bank account during the recent month as well as the balance in the bank account.
Alicia: When the company receives its bank statement, the company should verify that the amounts on the bank statement are consistent or compatible with the amounts in the company's Cash account in its cash ledger and vice versa. This process of confirming the amounts is referred to as bank reconciliation. 
Alicia: Bank reconciliation involves a regular comparison of bank statements with the cash ledger in order to determine any differences and clarify them, i.e. find possible errors and correct them, record non-recorded bank charges and determine any differences due to timing difference.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Alicia: Now let’s discuss about the documents used in this process.  
Alicia: Two basic documents used in this process are:
Bank statement - list of all transactions which occurred during a particular period of time and impacted cash in bank account of business. Such a statement is prepared by the bank and is provided to the company owning the bank account.
Alicia: Cash ledger - it is an accounting book of prime entry, listing all the transactions that impacted cash in bank and this book is prepared by the accountant. Please make mention of the fact that when you are completing your bookkeeping and accounting using a computer this journal is kept automatically by the accounting software. Most modern accounting software programs have a built in reconciliation feature that greatly assists with the reconciliation of bank accounts and credit card accounts.  
Alicia: It is required that entries on the bank statement are exactly the same as entries in the cash ledger, since cash ledger is a reflection of bank statement. Also the final balance in the bank statement should be equal to the final balance in the cash book. However, it might actually happen that the balance of cash ledger is not the same as the balance in the bank statement.
Alicia: The main reasons for such differences are:
Errors. There might be different types of errors, i.e. error in calculation the total balance, error in recording transaction which had impact on cash.
In the cash ledger non-recorded charges and interest accrued by the bank have not been reflected. Such expenses are recorded into the bank statement directly by the bank; therefore they are not immediately reflected in the cash book.
Difference in timing of transactions and charges. Certain checks received or paid, but not yet cleared, i.e. recorded in the cash book, but not yet reflected in the bank statement
Sally James: That was so inclusive, Alicia!  Before we begin to discuss our third segment, here is a Quick Quiz coming up for our viewers.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: John, would you please tell us, how to pick a right book-keeper who can help with all the financial statements? 
John: Selecting the right book-keeper can make a big difference to your business’ success and failure. After all, it's your financial numbers that make or break your business. You have to be real cautious while choosing your book-keeper as he or she gains a detailed knowledge of you, your business, and your data. 
John: Here are some guidelines which can help you in selecting a right book-keeper.
Before you start your business you should consult an accountant; this could be a: 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who is a sole practitioner or an accounting firm that can offer expertise in many areas (and whose fees typically tend to be higher). 
Another type of accountant is an “Enrolled Agent” (EA). EA’s must pass a taxation test administered by the Internal Revenue Service.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Like an accountant, is there any specific certification for book-keepers?
John: At present, there are no national certification standards for bookkeepers as there are for CPA’s or EA’s. So, it may be best to look for referrals when selecting a bookkeeper. Many CPA’s and EA’s will refer you to people they have confidence in to help you with your accounting needs. Bookkeepers range from those who only pay bills or process receipts to “full charge” bookkeepers who can summarize bookkeeping activity for your CPA or EA to prepare tax returns.
John: On the other hand, if you want someone to advise you on business organization and prepare income and payroll tax returns, you will probably want a CPA or EA to help you. The more “routine” bookkeeping you know and do yourself, the better it is, because you can then afford a higher level of expertise. ]]></TranscriptText>

Alicia: Sally, sooner or later, one is likely to need financing in addition to his/her start-up sources. It is important to establish banking relations BEFORE future needs arise. 
Alicia: For a start-up business, having a professional accountant on your team can make your life, as an entrepreneur, a lot simpler. 
Let’s see how an accountant can help in dealing with your banker.
Prepare cash flow control statements that will estimate what the cash needs of the business will be in months to come. 
Prepare a personal financial statement, including a balance sheet of your personal assets and liabilities along with a statement of income and expenses showing how much cash flow you generate each month. Banks will usually require a personal guarantee.
Locate a banker. This can be helpful because the banker has had prior dealings with the accountant.
Polish your business plan for your banker.
Organize as much information as possible including financial statements in a neat and orderly fashion.
Sally James: Before we move on to the next and the last segment of this episode, here is a small Quiz coming up for our viewers. ]]></TranscriptText>

Sally James: But Mathew, there are variety of options available in the market, so where do look for it and how?

Ask for advise in your industry whose judgments you trust about their experience with software.
Look for advertisements in trade magazines for software and visit booths at industry trade shows for ideas.
Mathew: Now, let’s talk about options available in accounting software. As technology improves, software vendors have been able to offer increasingly advanced software at lower prices. This software is suitable for companies at multiple stages of growth. 
Options for Expanding Companies
Many of the features of Mid Market and High End software (including advanced customization and extremely scalable databases) are required even by small businesses as they open multiple locations or grow in size. 
Additionally, with more and more companies expanding overseas or allowing workers to work from home, many smaller clients need to connect to multiple locations. Their options are to employ software-as-a-service or another application that offers them similar accessibility from multiple locations over the Internet. 
Options for Non-accountants
With the increasing dominance of having financial accounts prepared with Accounting Software as well as some suppliers' claims that anyone can prepare their own books, accounting software can be considered at risk of not providing appropriate information as non-accountants prepare accounting information. 
As recording and interpretation is left to software and expert systems, the necessity to have a Systems Accountant overseeing the accountancy system becomes even more important. The set up of the processes and the end result must be meticulously checked and maintained on a regular basis in order to develop and maintain the integrity of the data and the processes that manage these data. 
Sally James: Thanks Mathew for this valuable information! Before we end our program, let’s have a last quiz of this episode.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally: Lorie, when one thinks of starting a business, there are several options available when searching for financing. Some methods of raising funds are less difficult than others, but all require some planning. So how should this process begin?
Lorie: For start-up businesses, it is very important to understand financing and how to develop a basic plan. 
Lorie: Basic planning requires that you know the answer to these three questions:
Click each question mark to learn more.
What will you use the money for? 
You must know exactly where the money will be used. You must be specific, as generalities are recipes for disaster. Carefully identify the areas where the money should flow into your business.
Lorie: 
How much money do you need? 
You should calculate your needs to carry you through initial start-up and into your first several months of operation. It’s necessary to have a realistic picture of your needs. Many businesses fail because the money runs out before the business achieves profitability.
Lorie:
How will you pay back the money? 
You must have adequate cash flow from your business to repay the money to your funding source. Before asking for funds, make sure your fiscal projections and business integrity are soundly argued in a good business plan. Financial Statements are integral parts of a good business plan.
You need to show sufficient cash flow in your business for repayment. You do this with information, as found in an income statement, a balance sheet, and a projected cash flow statement.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: When you are planning to launch a business venture, it is vitally important to know that you will have enough money to keep it afloat. I am correct, Lorie?  
Lorie: You are absolutely right, Sally! This money required for starting a business is very important. Every business is different and has its own specific cash needs at different stages of development. Therefore there is no generic method for estimating your start-up costs.
Lorie: To determine your start-up costs, you must identify all the expenses your business will incur during its start-up phase. Some of these expenses will be one-time costs, such as the fee for incorporating your business and the price of a sign for your building. Some expenses will be ongoing such as the cost of utilities, inventory, insurance, etc.
While identifying these costs, decide whether they are essential or optional.
Lorie: A realistic start-up budget should only include those elements that are necessary to start the business. These essential expenses can then be divided into two separate categories: 
Lorie: The most effective way to calculate your start-up costs is to use a worksheet that lists the various categories of costs (both one-time and ongoing) that you will need to estimate prior to starting your business.
Roll-over each section of the pie chart to learn more about categories of expenses. 
Fixed (overhead) expenses. Fixed expenses will include the monthly rent, utilities, and administrative and insurance costs. 
Variable (related to business sales) expenses. Variable expenses will include inventory, shipping and packaging costs, sales commissions, and other costs associated with the direct sale of a product or service.]]></TranscriptText>

Lorie:  You are right Sally! Break Even Analysis is one of those things that many people are afraid of trying to understand because it involves a little bit of math - however the math is simple. So let’s try to grasp the concept because it is important for any kind of business whether it is small or large. 
Lorie: Basically, Breakeven analysis is nothing but a tool used to determine when a business will be able to cover all its expenses and begin to make a profit. For the start-up business, it is extremely important to know your start-up costs, which provides you with the information you need to generate enough sales revenue to pay the ongoing expenses related to running your business.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Lorie: Now let’s understand with an example how to do it. A start-up business owner must understand that $5,000 of product sales will not cover $5,000 in monthly overhead expenses. The cost of selling $5,000 in retail goods could easily be $3,000 at the wholesale price, so the $5,000 in sales revenue only provides $2,000 in gross profit. 
Lorie: In above example, breakeven point is reached when revenue equals all business costs. To calculate your breakeven point, you will need to identify your fixed and variable costs.
» Fixed costs are expenses that do not vary with sales volume, such as rent and administrative salaries. These expenses must be paid regardless of sales, and are often referred to as overhead costs.
» Variable costs fluctuate directly with sales volume, such as purchasing inventory, shipping, and manufacturing a product.]]></TranscriptText>

Lorie: My pleasure, Sally! 
Sally James: Continuing on the same theme.  Is the more we need to know about identifying our need for cash?
Lorie: Sally, when you are thinking of having a start up, you need to acknowledge that everything revolves around the cash. Maybe your business needs a lot of cash, maybe it only needs a little cash.  Either way, you have to ask yourself few simple questions as well as you need to prepare for what investors will ask.
Lorie: Before seeking financial assistance, ask yourself the following questions:
Do you need more capital or can you manage existing cash flow more effectively?
How do you define your need? Do you need money to expand or as a cushion against risk? 
How urgent is your need? You can obtain the best terms when you anticipate your needs rather than looking for money under pressure.
How great are your risks? All businesses carry risks, and the degree of risk will affect cost and available financing alternatives.
In what state of development is the business? Needs are most critical during transitional stages.
For what purposes will the capital be used? Any lender will require that capital be requested for very specific needs.
What is the state of your industry? Depressed, stable, or growth conditions require different approaches to money needs and sources. Businesses that prosper while others are in decline will often receive better funding terms.
Is your business seasonal or cyclical? Seasonal needs for financing are generally short term. Loans advanced for cyclical industries such as construction are designed to support a business through depressed periods.
How strong is your management team? Management is the most important element assessed by money sources.
Most importantly, how does your need for financing, mesh with your business plan? If you don’t have a business plan, make writing one, as your first priority.  All capital sources will want to see your business plan for the start-up and growth of your business.
Sally: This was all about Understanding Financing. Before we move on to our next segment, here’s a Quick Quiz for our viewers!]]></TranscriptText>

Sally James: The different sources of money we are going to discuss are: Credit cards, Friends and family, Personal savings, Lines of credit, Bank loan, Venture capital, Angel investors, SBA micro-loan, Small business investment companies, Business incubators, and Future customers.
Sally James: So you have a great business idea, a full proof business plan, updated knowledge of different hardware and software, legal permissions and licenses, and also the information about accounting. Now all you need is money. Lorie my question to you is, how one can get the start up money which will transform their new business from idea to success?
Lorie: Start-up businesses often have a difficult time finding sources of financing for their initial kick-start. It is often not possible to get bank loans because banks aren't interested in unproven businesses. Even with the best possible business plan, you may not be able to convince a bank to loan any of their often-scarce money available for credit for start-up financing to a brand new business.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: If that’s the case then what one should do? Is there any alternate way one can arrange money? 
Lorie: Yes there are options available for those who are starting a business. They just have to know where to look and think strategically and creatively. 
sources of money
Lorie: Here are some most likely sources for your new business. It is usually a good idea to try to use a combination of two, or even three, or these sources to get the start-up financing that you need for your new business.
Click each image to learn more about sources of money.
One form of personal debt you should avoid is cash advances on your credit card.
It's very tempting and very easy to get cash this way. This option is very expensive and extremely risky. Credit cards should only be used for short-term expenses, and not as a means to entirely fund a start-up business.
Borrowing from your friends and family, especially the rich folks, is a good way for new businesses to get money. It's not uncommon for relatives to make low interest or no interest loans to family members. Just make sure all parties are aware of any risks. You don't want to alienate your family, if the business falls on hard times, and you have trouble repaying the loan.
You can use your personal savings or assets that can be converted to cash. If your savings are already low, put off that vacation, drive your old car a bit longer, avoid large purchases — be thrifty in all areas and you can save faster for your business. Keep in mind that most lenders won't finance 100 percent of your business, so you'll need to invest some money yourself.
If you have good credit, you may be able to secure a line of credit from your bank. This can be handy in providing you with a source of working capital in the opening round of your business.
Using collateral, such as the equity in your home, you can approach your bank for a loan against your business. This may or may not be an option for you, since some banks prefer to separate personal equity from business debt.
People with lots of money love to make lots more money! Your job is to convince venture capital providers that you and your business can help them make lots more money. You must be able to show you've got a real winner. Therefore, you need to have a business plan. A good one that shows you've done your homework and know the "lay of the land." Venture capital providers want to be sure their investment is sound. They generally do this by taking ownership over a pretty big part of the company, and often require control of major portions of the business. This way they can look after their investment.
An angel, or private investor, is a person looking for good investment vehicles. This person could be your next door neighbor, your dentist, or a local business owner. Overall, angels are not loan-makers; they are investors. As such, the degree of control and terms under which you receive seed money for your business will depend on the arrangement brokered between you and your angel. The key to finding an angel investor in your area is networking. While you may not have an angel in your personal pool of contacts, by networking with others you can create a word of mouth campaign that reaches the ears of private investors. Moving outside of your local area, you can begin a sweeping search for private investors at BusinessFinance.com. They maintain a list of thousands of potential investors.
The Small Business Administration may be helpful in connecting you with a Microloan. These loans are administered by non-profit organizations that want to foster economic development in your area. Contact your regional SBA office for information on this loan program. You can find your local office using this online locator: http://www.sba.gov/regions/states.html
The SBA or your local Chamber of Commerce may be aware of Small Business Investment Corporations operating in your area. These organizations are interested in reviving depressed portions of your community, bringing employment to places with high unemployment, or even helping certain minority groups. They will work with new businesses if you meet the criteria they expect. You can visit the American Economic Development Council for a list of organizations in your area. http://www.aedc.org/
Business Incubators help build new businesses. They can help in all phases of start-up, including funding. Investigate whether or not an incubator exists in your area with the SBA, Chamber of Commerce, local universities, or your local municipality.
Your future customers may be a source of money. This is a less conventional method, and your timing must be right to coordinate this type of deal. You simply take advance orders for your product and collect at the time of the order. If you take enough orders, you can search for a lending institution which makes loans against accounts receivable.
Lorie: In the final analysis, the name of the game is perseverance. Get your name and idea out there in the real world. Start talking to people about your intent and become a good player. Have your business plan ready, be aggressive, and you can get the money you need. Here’s a comparative table of the sources of finance. This is only indicative, and actual figures may vary as per your business, location and other factors.

Sally: Well, I am sure our viewers must have got a clear picture about where to go for money. We are now going to take another quick break here. But before we move on to our next segment, here’s a Quick Quiz coming for our viewers.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Borrowing money is one of the most common sources of funding for a small business, but obtaining a loan isn’t always easy. Before you approach your banker for a loan, it is good to understand as much as you can about the factors the bank will evaluate when they consider making you a loan. Lorie, what are these factors one should study?
Lorie: For a start up, getting a bank loan is surely tough. It may feel like going through a maze. But it is not totally impossible. You just need to do your homework well.
Lorie: Here are some of the key factors a bank uses to analyze a potential borrower.
Click each bookmark to learn more about key factors a bank uses to analyze a potential borrower.  
The ability to repay must be justified in your loan package. 
Banks want to see two sources of repayment:
Cash-flow from the business.
Secondary source such as collateral.
In order to analyze the cash flow of the business, the lender will review the business plan. Generally, banks feel most comfortable dealing with a business that has been in existence for a number of years but they will also carefully consider a well written plan.
Lorie: One of the first things a bank will determine when a person/business requests a loan is whether their personal credit is good. Therefore before you go to the bank, or even start the process of preparing a loan request, you want to make sure your credit is good.
First get your personal credit report. You can obtain a report by calling TransUnion, www.myfico.com, Equifax, TRW or another credit bureau. It is important that you initiate this step well in advance of seeking a loan.
Personal credit reports may contain errors or be out of date. You want to make sure that when the bank pulls your credit report that all the errors have been corrected and your history is up to date.
On your credit report you will see a list of all the credit you have obtained in the past-credit cards, mortgages, student loans, etc. Each credit will be listed individually with information on how you paid that credit. Any credit where you have had a problem in paying will be listed towards the top of the list. These are the credits that may affect your ability to obtain a loan.
If you have been late by a month on an occasional payment, this probably will not adversely affect your credit. However, if you are continuously late in paying your credit, have a credit that was never paid and charged off, have a judgment against you, or have declared bankruptcy in the last 7 years, it is likely that you will have difficulty in obtaining a loan.
In some cases, a person has had a period of bad credit based on a divorce, medical crisis, or some other significant event. If you can show that your credit was good before and after this event and that you have tried to pay back those debts incurred in the period of bad credit, you should be able to obtain a loan. It is best if you write an explanation of your credit problems and how you have rectified them and attach this to your credit report in your loan package.
Each credit bureau has a slightly different way of presenting your credit information. Most sources of financing or credit have come to rely on a simple word to score your credit worthiness: FICO. FICO is a numeric method, using just three digits, to predict the likelihood of your paying your credit as agreed. FICO scores range from 365 (not good) to a high of 850 (great). The score evaluates your credit payment history, number of open accounts, overall credit balances and public records such as judgments and liens.
Generally, a FICO score above 680 will produce a positive response while a score below this will cause a lender to be cautious. A good way to obtain your own score is to enter “FICO” into a search engine. Several sources will charge a modest fee to calculate your score. Services like will provide you with several report formats and notify you of credit inquiries that could affect your score. Before seeking financing or credit, it is a good idea to know where your FICO score stands.
If you need assistance in interpreting or evaluating your credit report, you can ask your accountant or a friendly banker. If your credit report has a few problems on it, you may find that another bank may evaluate your credit report differently.
Financial institutions want to see a certain amount of equity in a business. Equity can be built up in a business through retained earnings or the injection of cash from either the owner or investors. Most banks want to see that the total liabilities or debt of a business is not more than 4 times the amount of equity.  
Therefore if you want a loan you must ensure that there is enough equity in the company to leverage that loan. Don’t be misled into thinking that start-up businesses can obtain 100% financing through conventional or special loan programs.
A business owner usually must put some of her/his own money into the business. The amount an individual must put into the business in order to obtain a loan is dependent on the type of loan, purpose and terms. For example, most banks want the owner to put in at least 20 - 40% of the total request.
Example: A new business needs a $100,000 to start. The business owner must put $20,000 of her own money into the new business as equity. Her loan will be $80,000. The debt to equity ratio is 4:1. Note also that this is only one of many factors used to evaluate the business — just having the right debt/equity ratio does not  guarantee you’ll get the loan.
Financial institutions are looking for a second source of repayment, which often is collateral. Collateral are those personal and business assets that can be sold to pay back the loan. Every loan program, even many microloan programs, requires at least some collateral to secure a loan. If a potential borrower has no collateral to secure a loan, she/he will need a co-signer that has collateral to pledge. Otherwise it may be difficult to obtain a loan.
The value of collateral is not based on the market value. It is discounted to take into account the value that would be lost if the assets had to be liquidated.
For a person that wants to open a business, and has no experience in that business, they will have difficulty getting financing. Unless, they intend to hire people who know the business, or take on a partner that has the appropriate experience. 
Regardless, you would be advised to take some time, to work in the business first, and take some entrepreneurial training classes.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Available only to US-based businesses, the SBA (the U.S. Small Business Administration) has assisted thousands of entrepreneurs start their own small businesses. Tell me, what one needs to learn about SBA, before seeking it’s help?
Lorie: The very first thing I would like to make clear is SBA doesn’t issue grants (money you don’t have to pay back) or make loans directly. Rather, it guarantees loans made by private lenders thereby reducing or eliminating the risk inherent in new business ventures and making lenders more willing to lend.
Lorie: The primary consideration for the SBA is repayment ability from the cash-flow of the business as well as “good character, management capability, collateral, and owner’s equity”. You will be expected to personally guarantee your loan. This means your personal assets are at risk. Here is the stepwise SBA loan process.
Click each step to get the SBA loan guarantee. 
Lorie: As for the types of businesses eligible for SBA loans, the SBA imposes the following criteria: the business must be “for-profit” (all that means is that your business has a profit motive, not that it has actually generated a profit yet), be engaged in business in the United States. There must be “reasonable” owner equity (what’s reasonable will depend on the circumstances) and you are expected to use alternative financial resources first, including your own assets where practicable.
Lorie: The SBA also imposes limitations on the use of loan proceeds. For example, although the proceeds can be used for most business purposes (the examples given by the SBA include “the purchase of real estate to house the business operations; construction, renovation or leasehold improvements; acquisition of furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment; purchase of inventory; and working capital”), you can’t use the loan proceeds for financing floor plan needs, to pay existing debt, to make payments to the business owners or to pay delinquent taxes etc.
Lorie: As a general rule, loans for working capital must be repaid within seven years and loans for fixed assets must be paid for by the end of the economic life of the assets (but not to exceed 25 years).
Lorie: Interest rates are negotiated between the borrower and the lender but the SBA imposes rates which are pegged to the Prime Rate.
Lorie: Finally, the SBA charges lenders a guarantee and servicing fee for each loan approved, and there is nothing preventing the lender on charging these fees to the borrower. The guarantee fee for a loan of $150,000 or less is 2% of the guaranteed amount; over $150,000 but below $700,000, it’s 3% and above $700,000 it’s 3.5%. The annual servicing fee is 0.5% which is calculated on the then-current loan balance.
Lorie: Where the borrower meets the SBA’s credit and eligibility requirements, it will guarantee up to 85% of loans $150,000 and less and up to 75% of loans above that amount (up to a maximum of $1,000,000). For more information about the various SBA loan  programs, visit the SBA website at http://www.sba.gov.

Let’s first view advantages of buying a business.
There are certain distinct advantages to be gained from buying an existing business.
Advantages of buying a business
You may be able to buy a business at a bargain price, if, for personal reasons, an owner is sufficiently eager to sell.
Buying a business as it stands will save time and effort in equipping and stocking it.
You gain customers accustomed to trading with the establishment.
Key personnel / employees along with the customer following may be willing to stay.
The “goodwill’ created by the previous owner may be a valuable asset.
Disadvantages of buying a business
You may pay too much for the business because of your inaccurate appraisal or the former owner’s misrepresentation.
If the owner had a bad reputation you would inherit prejudices of former customers and perhaps of merchandise and equipment suppliers.
The location may be unprofitable.
Fixtures and equipment may be outmoded or in bad condition. Check carefully!
Too much of the merchandise or materials on hand may be old or poorly selected. Evaluate stocks and inventory!]]></TranscriptText>

Marlon: Hi Sally, and thanks for inviting me on your show.
Sally James: Before we start our discussion with Marlon, let’s view the points  to be discussed in this segment. 
Sally James: In this segment, we will discuss: What kind of business to buy? How to find the right business? What should you research? How to close the deal? Soon after this, we will discuss about evaluating the worth of business, where we will talk about: What is business valuation? What are the methods for evaluating a business? How should you evaluate a business? What else should you look for in a business valuation?]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Marlon, when we talk about buying a business, what kind of homework should a person do?
Marlon: Well when I was planning to buy a business, I started out with making a list of questions.
Marlon: I prepared a questionnaire and divided it into two parts. First was the basics I should know and the second part was about evaluating the worth of business I wish to buy. Let’s start with the first part.
The first step to buy a business should be preparing a questionnaire. This questionnaire can be divided into two parts:
Part 1: The basics you should know when considering buying a business.
Part 2: How to evaluate the worth of the business you want to buy.
Click each highlighted section to learn more.
What kind of business to buy?
A good starting point for this is to think about the types of work you‘ve done in your life, your career experiences, educational qualifications and industry certifications you‘ve acquired, or perhaps special skills you‘ve developed as a hobby. It‘s almost always a mistake to buy a business you know too little about, no matter how promising it looks. Not only will you have to struggle through a big learning curve after you buy it, but you might not know enough about the industry to determine whether a particular business truly offers good value. In addition to buying a business in an industry that you know, try to choose one that you love. It‘s less difficult and a lot more fun to succeed in business when you enjoy the work you‘re doing!
How to find the right business?
After you‘ve decided what type of business you want to buy, you‘re ready to begin your hunt for the perfect company.
Consider starting your search close to home. For instance, if you‘re currently employed by a small business you like, find out about the present owner‘s circumstances and whether she/he would consider selling the company.
Ask business associates and friends for leads on similar businesses that may be on the market; many of the best business opportunities surface by word of mouth — and are snapped up before their owners even list them for sale. 
Other avenues to explore include newspaper ads, trade associations, real estate brokers and business suppliers.
Finally, there are business brokers — people who earn a commission from business owners who need help finding buyers. It‘s fine to use a broker to help locate a business opportunity, but it‘s foolish to rely completely on a broker for advice about the quality of a business or the fairness of its selling price. Remember that the broker doesn‘t make a commission unless he makes a sale! 
What should you research?
Before you seriously consider buying a particular business, find out as much as you can about it. 
Thoroughly review copies of the business‘ certified financial records including:
Cash flow statements, 
Balance sheets, 
Accounts payable and receivable, 
Employee file(including benefits and any employee contracts),
Major contracts and leases, 
Any past lawsuits, and
Other relevant information.
This review (lawyers call it “due diligence”) will tell you a lot about the company you‘re buying and will alert you to any potential problems.
How to close the deal?
If you‘ve thoroughly investigated a company and wish to go ahead with a purchase, there are a few more steps you‘ll have to take. 
They are: 
First, you and the owner will have to agree on a fair purchase price. A good way to do this is to hire an experienced appraiser who can estimate the company‘s fair market value. 
If all goes well, you and the business owner will agree on a fair price as well as other aspects of the purchase, such as which assets you will buy and the terms of payment—most often, businesses are purchased on an installment plan with a sizable down payment.
After you have outlined the terms on which you and the seller agree, you‘ll need to create a written sales agreement and possibly have a lawyer review it before you sign on the dotted line.
Marlon: Now let’s view the second part.
What is business valuation?
When buying or investing in a business, you need to evaluate that business carefully. Valuation is what a business is worth, as in “this company‘s valuation is $10 million.” This would mean that a company is valued at $10 million, or worth $10 million.
The term is used most often for discussions of sale or purchase of a company; its valuation is the price of a share times the number of shares outstanding, and the price of a share is the total valuation divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
How should you evaluate a business?
When valuing a business for sale, start by reviewing basic financial statements. Two major financial statements should be reviewed with their accountant, the balance sheet and the statement of income and expense.
Balance sheet
The Balance Sheet should show how the assets, liabilities and net worth of the business are valued. Items shown on the Balance Sheet may not tell the entire story. For example, is the equipment valued realistically? The equipment may be obsolete despite what is shown on the statement. Are the accounts receivable fully collectable? Also, the liabilities may not reflect contingent liabilities, such as a pending lawsuit or potential tax liabilities. These are just a few of the many questions you must ask to determine true value of a business.
Statement of income and expense
Looking at the next important financial statement is the Statement of Income and Expense (also called the Profit and Loss Statement). Are the sales correctly reflected? Unfortunately, many businesses dealing with cash do not deposit all the sales receipts. If so, how can the seller prove the correct sales? Or, when anticipating selling the business, the sales may be overstated. The expenses may contain personal items that are not business related. The point is that you need an experienced CPA or business appraiser who recognizes your interests to represent you when buying a business.
What are the methods for evaluating a business? 
Standard valuation methods may include:
Asset-based valuation: The business is worth the sum of its assets. Not a popular valuation method for new businesses, because their future should be worth a lot more than their assets.
Book value: The book value of a company is the calculation of assets less liabilities. 
Adjusted book value: This variation adjusts the assets – liabilities calculation for real value of assets, distinguished from the accounting value.
Liquidation value: What a business would yield in real money if its assets were liquidated. 
Replacement value: What it would cost to replace the business if the replacement started from scratch.
Earnings based valuations: This is by far the most popular method for new businesses; they are valued based on future earnings.
Balance sheet
The Balance Sheet should show how the assets, liabilities and net worth of the business are valued. Items shown on the Balance Sheet may not tell the entire story. For example, is the equipment valued realistically? The equipment may be obsolete despite what is shown on the statement. Are the accounts receivable fully collectable? Also, the liabilities may not reflect contingent liabilities, such as a pending lawsuit or potential tax liabilities. These are just a few of the many questions you must ask to determine true value of a business.
Statement of income and expense
Looking at the next important financial statement is the Statement of Income and Expense (also called the Profit and Loss Statement). Are the sales correctly reflected? Unfortunately, many businesses dealing with cash do not deposit all the sales receipts. If so, how can the seller prove the correct sales? Or, when anticipating selling the business, the sales may be overstated. The expenses may contain personal items that are not business related. The point is that you need an experienced CPA or business appraiser who recognizes your interests to represent you when buying a business.
What else should you look for in a business valuation?
Other factors to consider in the valuation process include:
Level of risk: How volatile is the business?
Competition: What is the competitive environment like—laid back and sleepy or fast paced and cut-throat?
Growth: Is this a growing or declining industry? How does that compare to the trend of the business, and what profitability trends do you see?
Organizational stability: How established is the business itself in terms of infrastructure and personnel?
Management team: Is there a competent management team in place and will they stay? Will that be an issue or an opportunity for you?
Overall desirability: Will the business be desirable for the “next” buyer? 
Marlon: Here I would like to suggest that, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. So, beware! Do your homework thoroughly and then go ahead.
Sally James: Well, that’s absolutely true! We will take a break here, but before we come back, here is a list of questions for you to answer.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Marlon now one has decided which business he wants to buy and from whom, what could be the next step before purchasing?
Marlon: The next step undoubtedly must be to understand the business plan before purchasing the business. 
Marlon: A business plan is normally essential to the process of purchasing a business. Ideally, during the purchasing process, you should receive a business plan from the previous owners.
A business plan is necessary because it defines:
The business prospects; therefore, sophisticated business sellers normally use a business plan as a selling document. It should contain information about business history, financial history, previous management, and possible prospects.
The business‘ specific mission and objectives, new ownership, sales focus, market, strategy, management team, and financials. This is particularly important when you are purchasing an existing business, because there is so much uncertainty involved.
Marlon: Along with the business plan you should:
Study the financial information,
Understand the forecasts, 
Do the reality checks, and 
Make the estimates
Click each image to learn more.
Financial Information
You should always have financial information. Normally you‘ll have past financial statements, and copies of tax forms, at the very least. Rarely do business transactions take place without some basic financial information. Use this financial information as a basis of comparison:
Question the information sources: copies of tax forms, if they are real, show what the sellers have told the government.
Do they match the financial statements from the bookkeeping?
How reliable are the financial statements?
Have they been audited by outside accountants?
Is the seller willing to allow an audit?
Forecasts: Growth forecasts are usually a warning sign and it is safe to consider them suspect. Compare projected growth to past results.
If the seller shows a future much more rosy than the past, ask why?
What assumptions justify the change?
Why was this business for sale if projections are optimistic?
However, sometimes sellers have good reasons—needing capital, aging, divorce, for example—so don‘t automatically assume that all growth projections are false. Try to understand why owners are selling a business, and how this affects their willingness to produce real numbers. Think about how it affects your own possibilities to make this purchased business work for you.
Reality Checks: Don‘t underestimate the importance of reality checks. It‘s not okay to rely on secondhand information. Where possible, spend time at the business in question, talk to customers, eat at the counter if it‘s a food business, and use the service. 
For retail locations, for example, you can spend some time outside the store, count the customers, see how many go in empty-handed and how many come out with bags.
Estimates: 
Make estimates. Count the business for some sample hours, and then calculate what total sales might be by multiplying your estimated average purchase value per hour. 
Sally James: Time for another break here. But before we move to our the next segment, here’s a Quick Quiz coming up for our viewers.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: For some entrepreneurs, buying an existing business represents less of a gamble than starting a new business from scratch. What would you suggest, Marlon?
Marlon: Sally, both the options have their own pros and cons. One cannot pin-point any specific reason for not buying an existing one or vice-a-versa. But here are some points, which may help you decide your path.
Marlon: Let’s start with which business to consider. 
With so many options available to you, the question is which business ownership arena should you pursue? Between franchises, existing businesses, start-ups, and home based businesses. It becomes a bit overwhelming.  
With any new business you have two challenges: developing the product or service and then seeing what if anything, people are willing to pay you for it. 
A new business will often cost more than an existing business of the same type. An existing business may be the only way to enter the industry. Location is an important factor. In some communities, certain types of business can no longer be built and an existing business will be the only way to enter the industry.
To take that comparison forward, here are some more points.
New business versus an existing one 
Benefits of setting up a new business:
The equipment and infrastructure is new and working
You can develop your own customer base
The area may be under-served
The value of the new business after you open may be greater than the cost of equipment
New and innovative ideas may be better executed
Benefits of purchasing an existing business:
The business has a track record of income and expenses
Operating costs are often lower than in a new business
The business will already have trained employees
There may be an existing base of loyal customers
The business may already dominate the market in the trade area.
Regardless of a company’s past performance, an existing business will, at the very least, have a history from which you will be able to make certain decisions. 
Even if the company was not profitable in the past, your strengths may lend themselves perfectly to turning it into a viable venture. Furthermore, you have the ability to verify what the company did in the past that resulted in the current status of the operation. Here are the pros and cons.
The business is ‘up and running’ already
It is likely to have an existing client base
The previous owners are likely to lend support and goodwill
There is a tried and tested business formula to emulate
The business can be sold again by yourself
Generally, a better chance of success than starting a similar business from scratch
A large investment is often required
Business transfer costs, i.e. solicitors, surveys, accountants, etc.
A large amount of time (and possibly travel) required to research the opportunities available
May require relocating yourself and your family.
There are few more benefits of buying an existing business.
Click each image to learn more. 
Ease of investigation
In order to buy the right business or franchise, you will be required to do a thorough investigation of its past activities, its operations, its current status, the competition, the industry and its future potential. Clearly, this information gathering will be substantially more accurate and easier to obtain when dealing with an existing business or franchise, as you will have the resources available from which to get the details.
Infrastructure
You will have the benefit of purchasing a company that has an infrastructure, including customers, suppliers, employees, equipment and systems. This will allow you to focus on building the business as opposed to a start up or new franchise where everything begins at ground zero.
Purchase Price Differences
Buying an existing business or franchise does not mean that it will cost you more. In fact, many times it is less expensive than building a new franchised location or launching a start-up. Even in those cases where it may require a premium, at least you know what you are getting if you investigate it properly.
Flexibility in negotiating
You will have far more flexibility when negotiating the purchase of an existing business or franchise versus any other options available. Everything from the purchase price to financing is open to negotiation.

Sally James: Apart from the questions we have discussed earlier, can there be any other questions to ask when considering the purchase of an existing business? 
Marlon: To be frank Sally, there can be numerous questions one can come up with when considering the purchase of an existing business. 
Marlon: I have got the list of possible questions ready with me. But depending upon the business you choose, you will be required to ask few more relevant questions. 
Why is the seller selling? The answer will either raise red flags or be consistent with, and met with no resistance when asking for the information in the issues raised below.
Have you asked to review the certified financial statements of income, cash flow and balance sheets for the last three years? If you borrow from a bank to purchase the venture, the bank will want to see them.
Have you asked to see the company‘s (not the owner‘s personal) IRS returns for the last three years? The bank will require these as well.
Have you asked for a copy of all documents of outstanding indebtedness like notes payable, accounts payable, real estate and equipment leases? Again, this are required by a bank or funding agency.
Has the seller offered to stay around for awhile after the sale to help with transition, and have you discussed some compensation for her/his services during that transition period?
Have you been allowed to talk with the employees, or is this sale of a confidential nature at this time? If so, why are the employees not being told of the impending sale?
Has there been any significant turnover of employees? If so, what is the reason for that?
Have you learned anything about the quality of customer relations at the company? Is there a close relationship between company and customers?
Have you learned anything about the relationship between the company and its vendors? 
Do vendors display preferred, regular or irregular relations with the company?
Are there any members of a management team for this company? If so, are they aware of the impending sale, and how do they feel about it?
What are the actual conditions of the working environment? Are there any hazardous situations or is this a well-kept workplace?
What are the actual conditions of existing fixed assets like office equipment, machinery, vehicles and the like? Do employees, managers and supervisors demonstrate good maintenance as well as cleanliness of company property?]]></TranscriptText>

Sally James: Thanks Marlon!  I am sure our viewers will find it very useful. Now tell us about the things one should avoid.  
Marlon: Sure, Sally!  Buying a business is a complex process, and it can be confounding because of the interplay of business, legal, and people issues. It can, however, be a rewarding process if it is the right business and you have done your homework and researched the business thoroughly. Here are some common mistakes that you should avoid when buying a business.
Buying the wrong business for you. Whether you plan to be a hands-on owner or hire managers to do the bulk of the work, most entrepreneurs need a business that suits their skills, knowledge, interests, and personality. Otherwise, the business may not be successful.
Signing contracts or agreements in your own name. Do not put contracts, loan agreements, or the lease in your name. You need to have or set up a corporation or LLC to buy the business, since you don’t want to subject your personal assets to the risks of the business.
Not doing proper “due diligence”. Just because a business appears to be successful, and even shows a profit, does not mean that it is not without problems. You need to find out exactly what is owned, borrowed, leased, and owed. You don’t want to get saddled with a pile of bills, unpaid vendors, rent due, and other outstanding debt.
Not knowing why the business is being sold. A business owner may simply say that he’s retiring. However, he may know that a competitive superstore has purchased the property across the street. Determine why the business is up for sale and what the business environment will be like once you take over.
Ignoring the company image. Most businesses have established an image or a brand over the years. Customers are familiar with this and changing it quickly can be self-defeating, since this image may be integral to the value of the business.
Not having a favorable purchase contract. Not unlike buying a home, you will need to negotiate details regarding the acquisition. From physical concerns regarding the property, to assets, intellectual property such as trademarks, stock, and outstanding bills, you need to define in the contract who is responsible for each area and exactly when and how the responsibility shifts from the seller to you as the buyer. It would be wise to consult an experienced corporate lawyer.
Overextending your own self financially. A common mistake is going into serious debt when buying a business. You are better off either waiting until you have sufficient funds to purchase without significant debt or putting together a buying team.
Making drastic internal changes. The time it takes to train a new staff can cost you money and drain your reserves. Often, the current employees are the most familiar with the internal workings of the company.
Not promoting the business. It is a big mistake to assume that since the business is already established it will simply promote itself. Even if the business has a solid base of steady customers, you need to immediately establish a comprehensive advertising and marketing plan.
Not knowing the value of the business. Buyers have to do a detailed financial analysis of the business to determine the appropriate price to pay. This includes reviewing income and loss statements, balance sheets, key assets, contingent and actual liabilities, and cash flow statements. You may find that it is more cost-effective to start from the ground floor with a brand new business.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Marlon,  first tell us what is a franchise and why should one think about buying one?
Marlon: A franchise is a right granted to an individual or group to market a company’s goods or services within a certain territory or location. The franchisor (the company owner) sells the rights to the franchisee and then typically receives a fee for ongoing support, therefore having a vested interest in the success of each franchise.
Marlon: There are many good reasons to pursue your dream of owning a successful franchise.
Here are ten good reasons!
Proven business: Opening a franchise comes with the advantage of knowing that this business has been successful in other locations. The idea and process of running this business have already been proven. Therefore, the learning curve in operating the business can be virtually eliminated.
Lower risk: Risk of failure is much lower with a franchise than starting a brand new business. There is a much higher likelihood of success if the same business has done well in other areas.
Established customer base: The brand name that comes with the franchise is already recognizable to consumers, without the franchisee (purchaser) having to spend a lot of money and time in establishing a new brand. The brand awareness provides security and trust to the customer who expects uniform quality to be provided. A customer base is already established.
Marketing: The franchisee can benefit from any advertising or promotion that the franchisor (owner of the franchise) does at the national or local level, without absorbing the cost. The franchisor can also provide input to the franchisee on a local marketing plan.
Initial and ongoing support: Training and support is usually part of the deal. Since the franchise company has a vested interest in how well you do in your business, ongoing training, system upgrades, product enhancements, and question and answer resources are provided. The franchisor offers experience to franchisee in such areas as accounting procedures, personnel and facility management, and business planning.
Possibility of an exclusive territory: With certain franchisors, you may also have the rights to an exclusive territory, with no other franchises sold in the same area as competition.
Ease of funding: Often, obtaining financing for a franchise is easier since the franchise name and reputation are usually recognized by the lenders. Therefore, banks are more likely to fund the franchisee.
Purchasing power: Relationships with suppliers are already established; affording the opportunity to buy in bulk, enabling a great deal of savings for the business.
Pre-purchase information and research. The potential franchisee can make an informed decision because of information that can be obtained prior to purchase. The Federal Trade Commission requires franchisors to provide the franchisee with certain information including the company’s history, information about the officers, litigation history, audited financial statements, the franchise agreement, and a current list of franchises with owners’ names and contact information.
Solid economic niche: Franchises cater to consumers’ specialized needs. Consumers tend to prefer doing business with companies that meet their specific needs and the franchise industry has been fitting the bill.
That was all about why should one think of buying a franchise. 
We will now see what to consider when buying a franchise.
The franchise concept is an incredible one. Gather all the ingredients specific to a business and formulate a recipe that can be duplicated over and over again by anybody! When someone refers to a “turnkey” operation, the most likely example is a properly orchestrated franchise. Although the recipe has been set, it still requires the input and management of the right owner to ensure an individual franchise / location is successful.
Click each emoticon to learn more.
The good news…
Franchises can be a good place to begin your entrepreneurial career. If you want to greatly improve your chances of success then buy a franchise resale. 
Take advantage of one that’s already established and successful. This way, you combine the best of both worlds: a franchise concept and the track record of an existing business. It just makes more sense.
While it is not always easy to locate resale, there are plenty of them around. The best way to find one is to call the Master Franchisers and ask if they can provide you with a resale listing in your area.
Approach any current owner and ask him/her if they know of any that may be for sale. They will probably even surprise you and say that theirs is, “for the right” price! 
In either case, you will get leads to pursue. Of course, you can always go through regular channels such as your local paper, business brokers and online listings.
The other good part of buying an existing franchise is that you can implement all of the same strategies for identifying, negotiating and financing the purchase as you would when buying an existing non-franchised business.
The bad news…
A franchise is by no means a guarantee of success. Plus, a new franchise is basically a start-up with some advantages.
Master Franchisers will do a load of demographic and marketing studies evaluating potential customer base, drive-by traffic, etc., but the only thing that they cannot do is guarantee your success nor will they document any specific revenues or profits. It’s really just an educated guess about what “may” happen.
All said and done, new franchises are, to a certain extent, a “build it and pray they will come” strategy.
Plus, a new franchise can sometimes mean waiting a year or more for it to be launched.
The investigation advantage with a franchise
Probably the most attractive feature of buying a franchise from the buyer’s point of view is that you can investigate any franchise much easier than an existing non-franchised business.
The reason for this is because you will be able to look at other franchises under the same banner.
You can speak with other franchisees in your area and they can offer a wealth of information.
There is also a disadvantage when investigating and conducting due diligence on a franchise as you have to do it on two fronts. You have to check out the business itself, of course, but of equal or greater importance.  You have to evaluate the Master Franchiser to be sure that they will deliver everything they are supposed to do.
Marlon: Sally, any kind of start-up has it’s own pros and cons. One has to decide what option suits him/her the best at the moment and go ahead on the path of success.
Sally James: That’s absolutely correct Marlon!  Before we bid goodbye, here is a last Quiz coming up for our viewers.

To best use these principles, a small business should: 
Determine the needs of their customers through market research.

Philip Kellar: Yes Sally, you are absolutely right! Each marketing plan needs to be thoroughly researched.
Sally James: Could you please explain it in detail?
Philip Kellar: Sure.
Philip Kellar: Here are two important things to consider while  drafting the marketing plan for any of  your business ventures.
Timely & Relevant Information
Market Research
Click each icon to learn more about market research. 
Timely & Relevant Information: Successful marketing requires timely and relevant market information. An inexpensive research program based on questionnaires used to survey current or prospective customers, can often uncover dissatisfaction or the demand for possible new products or services. 
Market Research: Market research will also identify trends that affect sales and profitability. Population shifts, legal developments, and the local economic situation should be monitored to quickly identify problems and opportunities. It is also important to keep up with competitors’ market strategies.]]></TranscriptText>

Philip Kellar: Knowing as much as we can about our competitors helps as build a more relevant and effective plan.
Sally James: And why you need a well crafted marketing strategy? 
Philip Kellar: A well-crafted marketing strategy identifies customer groups which a particular business can better serve than its target competitors. It also tailors product offerings, prices, distribution, promotional efforts, and services toward those segments. Ideally, the strategy should address unmet customer needs that offer adequate potential profitability. A good strategy helps a business focus on the target markets it can serve best.]]></TranscriptText>

Philip Kellar: It is essential, because owners of small businesses usually have limited resources to spend on marketing. 
Concentrating their efforts on one or a few key market segments—target marketing—gets the most return from your marketing investment. Let’s view the two methods used to segment a market.
Philip Kellar: The two methods used to segment a market are: Geographical  segmentation. 
Customer segmentation.
Click each icon to learn more about the target marketing process. 
Geographical  segmentation: Specializing in serving the needs of customers in a particular geographical area. For example, a neighborhood convenience store may send advertisements only to people living within one-half mile of the store. 
Customer segmentation: Identifying those people most likely to buy the product or service and targeting those groups.]]></TranscriptText>

Philip Kellar: Developing a marketing plan, that’s the next step. Marketing takes time and money. Developing a solid marketing plan is one of the most important things you can do to ensure you are spending marketing dollars wisely. 
Philip Kellar: There are a couple of things that you should do when developing a marketing plan; getting familiarized with advertising laws and what it takes to comply with these laws.
Three Things You Should Do After Deciding on your Marketing Strategy
Philip Kellar: Let’s view how to do these things. 
Click each image to learn more.
Develop a Marketing Plan
Marketing takes time and money. Developing a solid marketing plan is one of the most important things you can do to ensure you are spending marketing dollars wisely. 
Getting Familiarized And Complying With Advertising Laws:
Federal, state and local governments regulate different forms of advertising. Before starting a marketing campaign or even putting up a sign in front of your store, you should familiarize yourself with some basic rules for advertising. 
Marketing Performance
After implementing a marketing program, entrepreneurs must evaluate its performance. Every program should have performance standards to compare with actual results. Researching industry norms and past performances will help to develop appropriate standards. Entrepreneurs should audit their company’s performance at least quarterly. The key questions to ask are:
Is the company doing all it can to be customer-oriented?
Do employees ensure the customers are satisfied and want to come back?
Is it easy for the customer to find what he or she wants at a competitive price?

Sally James: Mr. Keller, we already discussed that a sound marketing plan is the key to the success of your business. Please tell us more about the various other issues we should consider while drafting a marketing plan.

Philip Kellar: Here is the sample marketing plan. It should include: Your market research, location, the customer group you have targeted, competition,  positioning, the product or service you are selling, pricing, advertising, and promotion. 
Philip Kellar: Always remember, effective marketing, planning, and promotion begin with current information about the marketplace. Search the Internet, talk to customers, study the advertising of other businesses in your community, and consult with any relevant industry associations. A marketing plan can be an interactive tool that helps you assess your marketing strengths and weaknesses.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Mr. Keller, let’s talk about the term marketing mix, what is it and how to define it? 
Philip Kellar: Well Sally, every marketing program contains four key components and these components are commonly known as the marketing mix. A successful entrepreneur should be able to achieve a happy balance of all the components. 
Sally James: What are these key components? 
Philip Kellar: Marketing consists of four major components: 
Product and Services,
Promotion, 
Distribution, and 
Pricing.
Click each tab to learn about the four major components of the marketing mix.  
Products and Services
Product strategies may include concentrating on a narrow product line, developing a highly specialized product or service, or providing a product-service package containing unusually high-quality service.
Promotion
Promotion strategies include advertising and direct customer interaction. Good salesmanship is essential for small businesses because of their limited ability to spend on advertising. Direct mail still is an effective, low-cost medium available to small business. Good telephone book / yellow pages advertising is important, but Internet marketing is perhaps the “magic mantra” for small business!
Distribution
The manufacturer and wholesaler must decide how to distribute their products. Working through established distributors or manufacturers’ agents is generally easiest for small manufacturers. Small retailers should consider cost and traffic flow in site selection, especially since advertising and rent can be reciprocal: a low-cost, low-traffic location means spending more on advertising to build traffic.
Pricing
The right price is crucial for maximizing total revenue. Generally, higher prices mean lower volume and vice-versa; however, small businesses can often command higher prices because of their personalized service.

Ms. Webb: Well Sally, we all know today it’s a world of competition and if one wants to survive you have to use the right marketing technique and material to get ahead. These techniques and materials, used by those who are involved in the promotion of goods and services, are the marketing tools.
Ms. Webb: Here are few marketing tools : 
Business name and logo
Promotion and advertising
Mailing lists
Establishing a Web presence
E-Marketing
Tradeshow marketing 
Let’s view them one by one.
Ms. Webb: The first and most important marketing tool is your business name and logo. 
Your business name will announce who you are and what you stand for. A memorable logo also adds to your marketability. It will establish your name and brand recognition. It will enhance the image you wish to create. Your logo can be used on all company materials including stationery, business cards, brochures, website, gift boxes and shipping containers.
Second comes the promotion and advertising. Your advertising plan becomes your blueprint for marketing. It will include your objectives, budget, media plan, and creative approach. A basic rule in promotion and advertising is, “Do what you do best, and hire for what you don’t.” Discuss your advertising plan with your vendors. There are many types of paid media to deliver your message. 
A few of the most commonly used are: 
Print, Radio, Television, Internet, Direct Mail, and Trade Shows. 
Click the more info button to learn more about promotion and advertising.
Every entrepreneur learns through experience that there is a most efficient way to spend advertising dollars. So, once again, learn from the previous mistakes of your competitors. Find out and follow how your most successful competitors advertise and promote their products or services. Whatever advertising media you decide to use, become knowledgeable regarding the do’s and don’ts of advertising in that particular medium. 
Media publicity, especially PR (public relations) is often available for free and helps to create a positive image for you business. Newspapers could be interested in writing a feature story about you because of the widespread interest in entrepreneurship and the fact that you are a successful start-up. Local newspapers, even the free ones, are very effective. 
Your “press release” must have news value that can be turned into a bit more of a feature story, as opposed to an announcement. This will make it more interesting and relevant to the reader. Editorial space is much more valuable to you than display space…and it’s free!
Mailing Lists
Now, before you start your business, is the right time to begin developing a database of future customers you wish to target.
This list can be used for direct mail, invitations, and newsletters. Your database could include specific individuals, companies and groups by location. 
Begin now to: 
Join the Chamber of Commerce. 
Collect business cards. 
Collect names or mailing lists from your church, school, organizations and community groups. 
Get involved in your industry and community affairs
The next marketing tool and a very important one in today’s internet world is establishing a web presence.
Establishing a Web Presence
Even if you choose not to sell your goods or services online, a business website can be a virtual marketing brochure that you can update on demand with little or no cost. 
Your presence on the Internet can be a useful marketing tool by providing richer pre-sale information or post-sale support and service. This might temporarily differentiate your product or service from your competitors’. 
E-marketing has lessened the disadvantage that small businesses have faced for years when competing with larger businesses.
E-commerce has redefined the marketplace, altered business strategies, and allowed global competition between local businesses. 
Rapid business transactions and unparalleled access to information is changing consumer behavior and expectations.
Many small businesses assume that the Internet has little value to them because they feel that their product or service cannot be easily sold online, but inexpensive information processing and electronic media can help most small businesses provide better, faster customer service and communication.
Email Marketing
Ms. Webb: Email marketing is one of the most effective ways to keep in touch with customers. It is generally cost-effective, and if done properly, can help build brand awareness and loyalty. At a typical cost of only a few cents per message, it’s a bargain compared to traditional direct mail at $1 or more per piece. In addition, response rates on email marketing are strong, ranging from 5 to 35% depending on the industry and format. Response rates for traditional mail averages in the 1 to 3% range. 
One of the benefits of email marketing is the demographic information that customers provide when signing up for your email newsletter. Discovering who your customers really are—age, gender, income, and special interests, for example, can help you target your products and services to their needs.
Some points to consider when creating your email newsletter are:
Click each arrow to learn more about creating your email newsletter.
HTML vs. Plain Text: Response rates for HTML newsletters are generally far higher than plain text, and graphics and colors tend to make the publications look far more professional. The downside is that HTML email is slower to download, and some email providers may screen out HTML email.
Provide incentive to subscribe: To get customers to sign up for your newsletter, advertise the benefits of receiving your newsletter, such as helpful tips, informative content, or early notification of special offers or campaigns.
Don’t just sell: Many studies suggest that email newsletters are read far more carefully when they offer information that is useful to the customers’ lives rather than merely selling products and services. Helpful tips, engaging content, and humor are often expected to accompany email newsletters.
Limit questions: As each demographic question you ask may reduce the number of customers signing up, it’s best to limit the amount of information you solicit or give customers the option of skipping the questionnaire.
Ms. Webb: Trade shows are designed to let entrepreneurs meet many potential customers inexpensively and face-to-face in a brief period of time. As trade shows generally take place at a single location, have short runs (usually one to three days), and bring together thousands of exhibitors and potential customers, they are a very powerful marketing medium.
Trade shows help level the playing field for smaller firms, since booth space is generally inexpensive, and even small companies can usually afford attractive displays.
With creative marketing and booth design, small businesses can actually appear as substantial as much larger corporations.
As business-to-business shows typically do not allow selling on the show floor, generating sales leads is the most common reason exhibitors participate.
Ms. Webb: So you see Sally, to get a success with your start-up you have to use combination of these marketing tools.
Sally: That’s right. It’s time for our Quick Quiz now. In the next segment we will discuss more marketing ideas.]]></TranscriptText>

Business expansion is the stage of a company’s lifecycle that is fraught with both opportunities and perils. Strategic planning can help you to take your business to the next level. To help us understand Strategic Planning with us today, we have Gina Laurence, President, Small Business Expansion Organization. Welcome to our show, Gina.
Gina: Hi Sally, Thanks a lot for inviting me on your show. 
Sally James: Before we start our discussion with Gina, let’s view the points for discussion in this segment.
Sally James: In this segment, we will look at:
Understanding what to expand, planning your business expansion, build a family dynasty and grow self-sufficiency for your community, build business value by dominating a market niche, attract and retain good employees, land the major clients that in turn lead to more financial support from lenders, achieve economies of scale.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Gina, to begin with,  I would like to ask you, what could be the very first step of business expansion? 
Gina: Sally, as a business owner, you need to understand precisely what to expand, in order that the scarce resources you do have, are optimized. 
Gina: Here are some areas where you may want to expand.
You may feel that increasing personnel helps increase production to meet growing demand.
Maximized labor can’t cope with the market demand and you have identified that automating business operations would both reduce costs and increase efficiency.
International demand cannot be met with the way the business is currently operating.
Diverse markets need localized service points.
You need to stock more inventory because price fluctuations don’t allow just-in-time procurement. You are contemplating using a warehouse facility for storage.
Your supply chain is hard pressed; it is difficult to manage with the existing logistics operation.
The need for expansion can be a combination of the above and you will know that you can hardly push it any further without expanding.
Gina: Having identified the exact nature of the expansion needed, the next step is careful planning. Let’s examine each of the cases.
Increasing personnel doesn’t have to hurt cash flow. The extra funds required can come from the increased revenue that is produced.
Automated machinery calls for extra skills for operating it. Ideally, you would train a few of your best people to operate the machines or hire additional personnel.
Opening localized service points need not be done by buying or renting real estate unless you have explored the possibility of outsourcing. This is where having a functional business website may also come in handy.
Sally James: Once you have identified the area and done with planning of expansion, what comes next?
Gina: Next comes the building of business in such way where you will gain a business advantage from expansion.
Gina: Following are the ways to gain a business advantage from expansion.
Click each image to learn more.
Build a family dynasty and grow community’s self-sufficiency:
Family pride, job relevance for family members, and building a business dynasty for not just your family, but for other families in your community as well, are a great reason for growth. Growth of a business, especially in a small community, can be seen as community economic development.
Build business value by dominating a market niche:
Business growth may garner your business the advantage it needs to be a leader in a market niche. You can move into new geographic markets, acquire more  customers or provide the next level of service to your present customers - perhaps, a service they have been asking you for. Growing your brand brings value to your business and quality to your customers. Both are important in creating goodwill in the marketplace.
Attract and retain good employees:
Employees are the new “green” resource in business, and the  excitement of growth offers the potential for career challenge that inspires skilled employees. Growing businesses offer change and the need to acquire new knowledge—both aspects that younger employees seek and the global economy demands.
Land the major clients that in turn lead to more financial support from lenders:
Landing a major client or contract can give your business the cachet that it needs to get others to follow. As you build your resume, financiers will take you more seriously, though they may sometime consider you more risky too. Your larger size will increase your marketplace presence and strength.
Achieve economies of scale:
The age old concept in business is economies of scale. This means that bigger businesses achieve lower costs per unit and stretch administration dollars over a larger product line: marketing, professional fees, insurance and banking charges, to name a few. This economy of scale contributes to having more money for R&D, sponsorships, employee training and education, investment in new technology and enabling greater productivity from employees.
Sally James: That was all about understanding what to expand and gaining a business advantage from expansion . Before we move on to our next segment, here’s a Quick Quiz coming up for this segment.]]></TranscriptText>

Sally James: When one starts a company, a business plan helps them to get through the startup phase and figure out his target market, niche, promotional activities, and day-to-day operations. But now when it's time for growth, Do they need a plan?
Gina: Of course! A business plan for expansion is a good idea because it's a road map that tells you where you want to go and how you'll get there.
Here are seven quick check points for creating a business expansion plan. 
Click each path to learn more about creating a business expansion plan.
Keep yourself updated on trends in your market. You need to stay one step ahead of your competition and take calculated risks. You don’t want to invest time and resources in writing a business plan for  expansion activities that are way off target for your market.
Read samples of business plans that target growth strategies. View business plans by industry on the Internet, but concentrate only on those that outline objectives for expansion.
Brainstorm expansion opportunities. Tap into your management’s creativity. Encourage them to throw out even the craziest ideas. Prepare a document collecting these ideas, distribute them to your staff and keep the dialogue going until you’ve honed them into workable goals.
Set financial goals for ideas like new products, services or markets. Decide on an annual figure you want to achieve and then break that down quarterly.
Spell out what you want new personnel to achieve quarterly and annually if your goals include expanding your staff. Write detailed job descriptions, tapping into the expertise of your HR department and supervisors.
Decide on a marketing plan. Find ways to create a buzz around your new products and services. Research what techniques will work best in new locations or niches you’re targeting.
Research how you can get financial backing for your expansion ideas. Know whether you’re targeting venture capitalists, loan officers or just depending on profits and investments to carry you through. Tailor your business plan with this knowledge.
Sally James: Well, that was very precise checklist. We are now going to take another break here. But before we move on to our next segment, here’s a Quick Quiz coming up for our audience.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Welcome back!! We are now at the third segment of our show where we are going to discuss different ways to expand your business. Before we start our discussion, let’s have a look at the following points.
Sally James: We are going to discuss how to increase your sales and products in existing markets, how to introduce a new product, how to develop a new market segment or move into a new, geographic area, whether to start a chain, to franchise or license our business, whether to join forces / strategic alliance, and how to go global.
Sally James: Once an entrepreneur has decided to expand and he is ready with his plan, what possibilities does he have?  
Gina: Small businesses can expand their operations by pursuing any number of avenues. The most commonplace methods by which small companies increase their business are incremental in character, i.e., increasing product inventory or services rendered without making full scale changes to facilities or other operational components. 
Gina: Here are some ways of expanding business outlined for you. Choosing the proper one (or ones) for your business will depend on the type of business you own, your available resources, and how much money, time and energy you're willing to invest.
Click each path to learn more about ways to expand your business.
Increase Your Sales And Products In Existing Markets
This is obviously the easiest and most risk-free way to expand. This tactic may require a bigger location, different pricing strategies, new/improved marketing techniques—but it will be in a customer group with whom you already have a relationship. If you go off track, your present customers will likely be the first ones to let you know!
Introduce a New Product
You have a successful product/service that you have been offering for some time and have been collecting data, customer feedback for your newest product. This is a normal evolution in business, not just an expansion tactic. When positioned as adding value and being responsive to customer needs, this can be a relatively risk-free way to expand.
Develop a New Market Segment or Move Into a New Geography
Both of these areas require cost outlays and uncertainty. Moving your products into new categories or demographic segments require market research, beta testing and new marketing strategies, i.e. a message for a 16-year old will mostly differ from one for a 60-year old. Management of new remote locations may absorb significant time and attention. While the risks are more, the payoffs are large - and for most businesses looking to expand, these two methods of expansion are inevitable.
Start a Chain
A restaurant, retail or service business that’s easily reproduced and can be run from a distance is all you need to launch a chain. But, you must be cognizant of what made the first location a success—was it the location, your staff or you? If it is just you, then duplication is only possible through detailed operation plans and sharing staff between locations. You will need to duplicate the plan of your first location while meeting increased customer demands. Starting a chain gives your current staff a crack at “management” duties, training opportunities and an opportunity to expand their horizons.
Franchise or License
While it’s a quick way to grow, a franchise agreement can be costly to prepare. You will need to be a good teacher, be able to prepare the training manuals (preferably in more than one language), be very organized and willing to travel. Licensing can carry less risk, but demands giving up a certain amount of control. Licensing a patent, trademark or industrial design often means that you sell manufacturing, distribution, or production rights.
Join Forces/Strategic Alliance
A merger or acquisition combines the best of two companies, expands your customer base, increases intellectual capital and delivers operational efficiencies. The trick is to find the right partner. These partners may be new distributors, but be forewarned that large retailers exact heavy performance expectations. Can you perform to the letter of your promise? Can you meet high standards of quality (ISO, or the like) and adapt your procedures to meet just-in-time delivery? Due diligence and strong contractual arrangements are essential here.
Go Global
You can decide to go global in a number of ways. Growing markets, rising consumer spending, improved business climate—sometimes the only place to find these things is overseas. Doing business internationally can take the form of exporting, licensing, a joint venture or manufacturing, but whatever form you choose, the basic business rules apply: assess customer demand, gain legal and accounting assistance, protect intellectual property and obey regulations.

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Welcome back!! We are in conversation with Gina Laurence and in this segment we are going to discuss expansion issues. Before we start our discussion, let’s have a look at these points
Sally James: We are going to talk about growing too fast, recordkeeping and other infrastructure needs, expansion capital, personnel issues, customer service, disagreements among ownership, family issues, metamorphosis of company culture. 
Sally James: Whatever method a company chooses to utilize to expand—and whatever guiding strategy it chooses to employ—its owners will likely face a combination of potentially vexing issues as they try to grow their business in a smooth and productive manner. Am I right Gina?
Gina:  Yes, expanding a company doesn’t just mean grappling with the same problems on a larger scale. It means understanding, adjusting to, and managing a whole new set of challenges—in essence, a very different business.
Gina: Here are some major issues one can face during expansion.
Click each circle to learn more about expansion issues.  
Growing Too Fast
This is a common malady that strikes ambitious and talented entrepreneurs who have built a thriving business that meets a strong demand for a specific set of goods and/or services. Companies growing at a very fast pace sometimes pay a steep price for their success.
Controlling fast-track growth and the problems that come with it, can be one of the most daunting tasks an entrepreneur will face. This problem most often strikes on the operational end of a business. In other cases, a business may undergo a period of feverish expansion into previously untapped markets, only to find that securing a meaningful share of that market brings them unacceptably low profit margins. Effective research and long range planning can do a lot to relieve the problems often associated with rapid business expansion.
Recordkeeping and Other Infrastructure Needs
It is essential for small businesses that are undergoing expansion to establish or update systems for monitoring cash flow, tracking inventories and deliveries, managing finances, tracking human resources information, and myriad other aspects of the rapidly expanding business operation. 
Many software programs, currently available in the marketplace, can help small businesses implement systems designed to address these recordkeeping requirements. 
In addition, growing enterprises often have to invest in more sophisticated communication systems, in order to provide adequate support to various business operations.
Expansion Capital
Small businesses experiencing growth often require additional financing. Finding expansion capital can be a frustrating experience for the ill-prepared entrepreneur, but for those who plan ahead, it can be far less painful. Businesses should revise their business plan on an annual basis and update marketing strategies accordingly,  so that you are equipped to secure financing under the most advantageous terms possible.
Personnel Issues
Growing companies will always have to hire new personnel to meet the demands associated with new production, new marketing campaigns, new recordkeeping and administrative requirements, etc. Careful hiring practices are always essential, but they are even more so when a business is engaged in a sensitive period of expansion.
Business expansion also brings increased opportunities, for staff members who were a part of the business in its early days. 
Small business owners also need to recognize that business growth often triggers the departure of workers who are either unable or unwilling to adjust to the changing business environment.
Customer Service
Good customer service is often a significant factor in small business success, but ironically, it is also one of the first things that tends to fall by the wayside when business growth takes on a hectic flavor.
Under such scenarios, businesses not only have greater difficulty retaining existing clients, but also become less effective at securing new business. A key to minimizing such developments is to maintain adequate staffing levels to ensure that customers receive the attention and service they demand (and deserve).
Disagreements Among Ownership
On many occasions, ownership arrangements that functioned fairly effectively during the early stages of a company’s life can become increasingly problematic as business issues become more complex and divergent as philosophies emerge.
One founder may want to devote resources to exploring new marketing niches, while the other may be convinced that consolidation of the company’s presence in existing markets is the way to go.
In such instances, the departure of one or more partners may be necessary to establish a unified direction for the growing company.
Family Issues
Embarking on a strategy of aggressive business expansion typically entails an extensive sacrifice of time—and often of money—on the part of the owner (or owners). Many growing companies, especially those founded by younger entrepreneurs, are established at a time when all of the co-founders are either unmarried or in the early stages of a marriage. As the size of the company grows, so does the size of the co-founders family(ies). 
Co-founders with young children may feel the pressure to spend more time at home, but their absence will significantly reduce their ability to make a continuous, valuable contribution to the company’s growth. 
Entrepreneurs pondering a strategy of business growth, then, need to decide whether they are willing to make the sacrifices that such initiatives often require.
Metamorphosis of company culture
As companies grow, entrepreneurs often find it increasingly difficult for them to keep the business grounded on the bedrock values that were instituted in its early days. Owners are ultimately the people that are most responsible for  communicating those values to employees. As staff size increases, markets grow, and deadlines proliferate, that responsibility gradually falls by the wayside and the company culture becomes one that is far different from the one that was in place — and enjoyed — just a few short years ago.
Entrepreneurs need to make sure that they stay attentive to their obligations and role in shaping company culture.
Sally James: Gina thanks for the comprehensive information on issues one can face. We  are going to take another break here. But before we move on to our last segment, here is a Quick Quiz coming up for this segment.]]></TranscriptText>

									<TranscriptText><![CDATA[Sally James: Welcome back to our last segment of tonight’s episode, where we are going to talk about how to use technology to aid expansion. Before we start our discussion, let’s have a look at the points for discussion.
Sally James: We are going to talk about general information about how to use technology to ease your load, selecting the technology carefully, considering simple solutions, practicing smart computing, looking at outsourcing, driving a hard bargain, using what you buy/invest in.
Sally James: There are many technical assistance resources available to assist in fulfilling the business development goals. Gina, how can technology be used to aid the expansion?
Gina: In today’s cost-conscious environment, technology may be the best partner of all for smaller firms. Whether it’s an effective website, a good piece of business management software or a powerful new computer, technology can support a host of core activities.
Gina: But just as with staffing questions or strategic shifts, technology needs to be carefully considered and managed to generate a maximum return on investment. Here are a few tech-savvy maxims to consider.
Click each tab to learn more.
Use technology to ease your load 
Technology alone can’t ignite growth or solve all your growth problems. Yet, as part of an integrated expansion strategy, it can provide the extra edge a growing business needs.
Software is designed to automate, simplify and expedite the things you want to accomplish.
Lean on technology to make quick work of time-consuming manual processes, such as number crunching, check generation and database publishing.
Use it to capture and manage often-elusive data on customer contacts and habits.
Put it to work to spot trends that aren’t evident in day-to-day routines.
Choose carefully
Small-to-mid-sized businesses can get carried away with automation. It’s a fallacy that all processes need to be automated. Small businesses harm themselves by focusing too much on technology. Choosing the right tools from among the many technology options available is crucial. Too often, businesses choose the wrong software and paint themselves into a corner. Comparison-shopping is important, as is looking for vendors that offer inter-operable, expandable and scalable products that can grow with your company.
Consider simple solutions
Not every business challenge requires a full-fledged technology hammer. If an accounting package is beyond your abilities or budget, for example, try using a single credit card for all business purchases. With most credit cards today, you can download spending data from the Internet and then analyze it.
Practice smart computing
Whether you buy software or build your own tools in-house, don’t overlook the basics of good computing. Technology is only as reliable as the people using it.
Outline a set of technology procedures for securing your data from outside eyes and equipment failure.
Ensure that all employees are familiar with the procedures and follow them.
If you’re going to rely on technology and you don’t have the discipline for multiple back-ups, your ability to survive is limited.
One hard disk crash can put you out of business
Look at outsourcing
Rapid growth often leaves little time for managing a technology department. That’s why some companies consider outsourcing. Very small businesses tend to err on the side of doing too much in-house. Even if you think it makes financial sense for in-house personnel to write an essential piece of software, you may not have factored in the cost of maintaining and updating the software as the years go by.
Ask yourself two questions:
Will it take you less time, effort and cost to manage the outsourcing relationship than it would to complete the task in-house?
Is the product or activity you are thinking of outsourcing so far outside of your business that mastering it won’t advance your core competence and strategy?
If you answer “yes” to both, then outsourcing is likely to be the right answer for you.
Drive a hard bargain
Technology doesn’t come at a set price, particularly when you need customization or installation services. Don’t be afraid to shop around and then press vendors for a price that suits you. Always be a good consumer and get multiple quotes. Say how much you are willing to pay for something. If an offer is not accepted, you can always call back and say, “OK, I will pay your full price.”
Use what you buy/invest in
Once you’ve paid good money for a new software application or industrial strength printer, use your investment to its maximum potential.
Get to know the capabilities of the technology you’ve bought, and use them to help you grow.
Take accounting software. Not only does it keep the books; it can also discover trends in customers’ payments, allowing you to predict cash-flow in the near future.
As this example suggests, your IT acquisitions need not only adapt as you grow, but must also identify emerging patterns and red-flag operational problems, providing you with the information you need to keep your company’s growth strategy on course.
Sally James: So you see, with the right business technology you can integrate your business, improve customer service, make more informed business decisions, and move into online sales. 
Now, we are at the end of our program but before we say bye, let’s have a last quiz of this episode.]]></TranscriptText>
